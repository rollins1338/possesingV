He undid her jeans, yanked them to
her knees, and slipped his fingers inside her. She sat up with an outraged
shriek as he retracted his hand. Before she could defend herself, he shoved
those same fingers into her mouth so deep that she gagged.
“Tell me again you don’t want me,” Jesse mocked.
Along with bile, she tasted her own honey. She wrenched her head to
the side and coughed.
“We’re not going backwards,” Jesse declared with frightening calm as
he positioned her on her hands and knees and knelt behind her. “Nothing’s
coming between us. No other guys, Mom and Dad, even God.”
She reached back and pushed at him. “You can’t do this!”
“I have to do this. For both of us.” When she tried to scramble away, he
pulled her back and smacked her butt hard enough to stun her into
immobility. “You’re scared of what people think and too ashamed to admit
what you really want.”
His fingers slipped inside her.
“Soaked, just like I knew you would be. Are you wet for your brother,
Violet?”
“Stop!” she sobbed as she tore at the grass to get away.
He gripped her hips, hauling her backwards, and slammed in to the hilt.
She screamed. The horrible sound bounced off the trees and ricocheted back
to them. As she hung her head, panting, she waited for the distant shout of
some Good Samaritan coming to the rescue, but there was nothing but the
pleasant sound of the stream, which she now realized would drown out any
call for help.
“I come here often because of how isolated it is,” Jesse said as he
blanketed her much smaller form. “Scream all you want. Nobody’s going to
hear you.”
“This isn’t you,” she said, her voice thick with tears. “Something’s
wrong. Can’t you see that?”
“You’re what’s wrong with me,” he groaned into her hair. “I haven’t
been sane for over a year. You love toying with me and throwing obstacles
in my path. I’d let you do whatever you want to me, but the moment things
get rough, you want to run. I’m not going to let you do that anymore.
You’re sticking with me.”
He began to move in shallow, hard thrusts that stabbed something inside
her that made her keen and uproot the ground around her.
“How can anything that feels so fucking good be a sin, Violet?” he
panted as his hand slipped under her blouse and stroked her stomach. “We
were made for each other. Can’t you feel it?”
She let out a choked sob as he planted himself deep. She couldn’t
believe this was happening—that he was so far gone that he would take her
in a public place. He was ruthless, shameless, completely out of control. As
he began to move more forcefully, her knees sank into the soft earth.
“We’re supposed to be together. Everything in me says so. I know you
feel it, too. I’d do anything for you, baby, anything.”
She shook her head.
He slowed his pace and pressed his cheek against her clammy one.
“What, baby?”
“You wouldn’t do anything for me,” she said raggedly.
“Of course I would,” he whispered as he rocked his hips. “Tell me what
you want, and I’ll give it to you.”
“I want you to stop.”
He abruptly pushed on her shoulders, so her face was mashed in the
grass and her butt was up in the air.
“You don’t want me to stop, and I’m going to prove it.”

JESSE.
Violet’s upper body arched as she released a beautiful, muted
scream before she went limp. As he lapped up what poured from her, she
shuddered and tried to scoot away, but her body was weak and
uncoordinated, and she was no match for him. Eventually, she gave up and
let him have his way.
When he was content, he rested his cheek on her sticky inner thigh.
He’d never been drunk or high, but he suspected it was similar to how he
felt right now.
For a few hellish hours, he thought he may have lost her, but she was
back where she belonged. He sated his demons and made sure he fed hers,
too. He fucked her on her hands and knees before he went 69, straddling her
face, forcing her to get him hard again while he made her come with his
mouth. After that, he took her missionary with her ankles resting on his
shoulders. That’s when she began babbling about sin, Amnon and Tamar,
and some deal she’d made with God. He didn’t care about a fucked up,
incestuous relationship that happened three thousand years ago or what she
promised God. He had his own deal with God—her. He lost his father so
that God could bring Violet into his life. She was his destiny, his salvation,
his. She belonged to him and he to her. Why couldn’t she see that? What
she labeled as sin felt like a spiritual cleansing to him. She was home to
him, and he wouldn’t let her destroy the ties he’d so carefully nurtured.
She climaxed when he did her missionary and then burst into tears.
He’d never heard her cry like that before. She was distraught, inconsolable.
Nothing he said would calm her, so he did the only thing he could think of
—turn those pitiful cries into gasps of pleasure by burying his face in his
favorite place. She fought him and called for help until she was hoarse, but
God was on his side. No one interfered. He made her beg for release and
wrung out two more orgasms from her before he was satisfied.
He kissed her mound before he got to his feet and sorted himself out. He
absently brushed debris from his legs before pulling his jeans up. He was
grateful he’d worn a black shirt instead of white. If not, it would have been
covered in dirt and grass stains from all the rolling around on the ground
they’d just done.
He surveyed Violet, who made a delectable picture. She was splayed on
her back, blouse hiked up to expose her abdomen and bra, jeans caught on
one ankle while her other leg was completely bare. Her pussy glistened
from his ministrations, inner thighs red and swollen from the love bites he’d
left behind. The urge to wring more affirmations from her was tempting, but
they didn’t have time.
He retrieved her torn underwear and pocketed them before he crouched
beside her. “Vi.”
Her only reaction to his voice was a tear that slipped from the corner of
her closed eyelids.
“We have to go, baby,” he said before he gripped her limp hands and
pulled her up.
He wasn’t surprised when she swayed on her feet. He’d been rough.
Brutal, actually, but hearing her chalk up the best days of his life as “nice”
and her dismissal of their relationship put him into a mindless state that
didn’t leave room for tenderness.
He steadied her before he unfolded her crumpled blouse and brushed
grass, dirt, and leaves from her before he fed her leg into her pants and
pulled them up. Both of their jeans were suspiciously dirty, but thankfully
his dark shirt and her colorful top hid the worst of the stains.
“Can you walk?” he asked.
When she didn’t acknowledge him, he inwardly shrugged and put her
over his shoulder. She didn’t fight or utter a sound. They were a ways from
the parking lot, but now that he’d had her, he felt like he could climb Mount
Everest.
He was grateful he didn’t pass anyone on the path. He opened the SUV
and settled her in the passenger seat. She finally opened her eyes, but didn’t
look at him. She stared straight ahead, expression blank.
He climbed in to fasten her seatbelt. She didn’t react when he caressed
her breasts or kissed her temple. She was acting like a lifeless doll. She was
punishing herself for what they’d done, but he knew how to bring her back
to life. When his mouth was between her legs, when he sucked on her
nipples and played with her asshole, she went wild. Whatever was going on
in her mind, he would overcome. He wouldn’t allow her to withdraw, not
when she was finally his. He would do whatever was necessary to keep her.
He retrieved his phone from his backpack before getting into the
driver’s seat. He wasn’t surprised to see thirty text messages and over a
dozen calls from his teammates. He would deal with that later. The only
missed call he cared about was Mom’s. He called her back as he turned the
key in the ignition.
“Are you home?” Mom asked.
“No, we’re on our way. Violet wanted to take a walk at the park. We’re
leaving now.”
He glanced at Violet as he reversed. She was doing a good job of
imitating a mannequin.
“Coach Rick called Dad and I,” Mom said.
“I’m not surprised.”
“I’m sorry, Jesse, but Isaac feels that—”
“It’s okay, Mom.”
She sighed. “I’ll see you two at home. Can you start dinner?”
“Sure.”
“Thanks, son.”
“No problem.”
He hung up, tossed his phone in the cupholder, and rested his hand on
Violet’s thigh. She didn’t push him away, which pleased him. What he felt
when he pummeled Tucker was nothing compared to the red haze that
engulfed him this morning when she tried to end them. The only reason he
hadn’t pulled over to deal with Violet was because he knew his parents
would be expecting a call from Coach Rick after he quit the team. Once that
was out of the way, he would deal with Violet. They wouldn’t go home until
things were set right between them.
He stroked her thigh. What he’d done was wrong, but it was hard to feel
guilty when he’d come inside her, had her taste on his tongue, and she was
sitting docilely beside him, letting him touch her. Right and wrong ceased
to matter where she was concerned. His need to possess her trumped all
else.
The days leading up to Sunday had been a dream. Violet surpassed
every fantasy. He worried he would scare her with his intensity and need,
but she not only matched him, at times it seemed her desires surpassed his.
She eagerly jumped into every scenario he created. He couldn’t believe she
was finally his. Their bodies were made for each other. They were so in
tune, words weren’t necessary. Everything was perfect until that fucking
phone call, which tore down the walls of the alternate reality he constructed
around Violet to insulate her from the outside world.
The stark terror on her face when Isaac nearly discovered them in the
bathroom told him she wasn’t ready to come out to their parents. Between
finding out that worthless bastard was in the hospital and Pastor Sonny’s
sermon, he knew the progress he made had taken a major hit. Sensing her
mental anguish in church, he tried to comfort her, but she rejected him.
With their parents present, he’d been forced to give her space.
Discovering she had barred him from her bedroom was a nasty shock. He
hadn’t slept and had no choice but to draw his own conclusions about what
that meant, which she confirmed this morning on the ride to school.
A part of her was still that lonely girl, afraid of being abandoned if she
let people down. Yesterday, she crumbled under the weight of their parent’s
disappointment. He had never viewed her need for love and acceptance as a
defect until he realized she would never choose him over their parents. That
wouldn’t do.
If Mom and Dad found out, they wouldn’t excuse such blatant
immorality or allow it to flourish under their roof. He suspected their
parents would go so far as to separate them. He was willing to face
whatever consequences came from his actions, but he had to make sure
Violet would stick by him, and she wasn’t there. Not even close. She would
rather break up than defy their parents.
He ignored the fire that heated his blood. They would get there. One
day, Violet would love him with the same fervor that he did her. Until then,
he intended to keep her as close to him as possible. He wasn’t going to let
Pastor’s Sonny’s lesson about King David’s mistakes or their parent’s
disapproval keep him from her. He loved her. His life revolved around her.
He wouldn’t let anyone come between them.
When they pulled up to the house, he was relieved to see Dad’s truck
was gone. He slipped on his backpack before going around to Violet’s door.
She displayed no awareness of their surroundings or him. Her face was
smudged with dirt, hair a tangled mess, and if either of their parents caught
a glimpse of her, no explanation would get him out of this.
“We’re home, baby,” he said as he undid her seatbelt, shouldered her
bag and tugged her into his arms.
He carried her to the house and hoped the neighbors were otherwise
occupied. He headed straight for their bathroom and kicked both doors
closed before he set her in the tub. He dropped their bags and caught her
before she collapsed.
“We have to clean up.” He flicked a ladybug out of her hair. “Do you
want me to bathe you?”
She looked right through him with eyes the color of rich moss.
He cupped her cheek. “Violet?”
No response.
“I’ll take care of you,” he said and began to strip her.
Once her clothes were in a pile, he got naked and climbed in with her.
He expected her to balk when he started positioning her so he could clean
her thoroughly, but she remained strangely compliant throughout. He was
grateful, since he didn’t know how much time they had.
“I’m sorry I was so rough,” he said as he ran the soapy washcloth over
her skin. “Are you hurt?”
She didn’t answer.
He had to shampoo her hair twice. He scrubbed every inch of her,
including the bottom of her feet and between every toe. He wished he could
linger. The fact that she was allowing him to care for her so intimately
without shame pacified the entity inside him that had compelled him to take
her so savagely. The need to reinforce their physical bonds consumed him.
He planned to possess her as frequently as possible to maintain their
connection, especially when her mind and body were at war with one
another. Eventually, they would align once she stopped fighting what was
between them.
Even though he’d had her multiple times, his body reacted to her
nearness. He couldn’t be around her and not want her. He thought once she
belonged to him that his obsession would ease, but it was worse than ever.
She stood in the back of the shower, as animated as a statue, as he
quickly cleaned himself. She didn’t react to the water that dripped down her
face or when he came to her. He couldn’t resist giving her a gentle kiss she
didn’t return before he wrung out her hair, wrapped it in a towel, and hastily
dried her.
His senses were on high alert as he dressed her in sweats. The only sign
of the rough sex they had at the park was her swollen lips, but that could be
excused in a dozen ways. He carried her into the living room, settled her on
the couch, and put on her favorite show.
“I’m going to start dinner. Do you need anything?”
She didn’t look at him or acknowledge his question. He kissed her
forehead before he went into the kitchen. From the tortillas, beans, and
vegetables Mom had on the counter, he deduced dinner was supposed to be
tacos. Once the vegetables were cut and the hamburger was simmering on
the stove, he fetched Violet’s hairbrush.
He settled her on the floor between his legs and combed her hair. He’d
always loved playing with her hair. So much so, Mom taught him how to
braid it. He did so now before he placed her back on the couch and
switched positions, so he was on his knees facing her.
Her eyes were more hazel than that startling green. His coddling was
having the desired effect. Before Mom and Dad arrived, he needed her
coherent. Violet had always worn her emotions on her sleeve. A lack of
them would be more noticeable than anything else she could do.
“Violet.”
No reaction.
He stroked the apple of her cheek. “What’s between us isn’t sinful.”
Her eyes focused on him.
“People search all their lives for the connection we have between us. It’s
rare and special. It’s worth fighting for.”
Her gaze flicked away. The entity inside of him snarled at the rejection,
but he had to be patient. He couldn’t force her to catch up to his level of
adoration and worship.
“Do you remember what you said after Mom and Dad left for their
honeymoon?”
She didn’t move, but he sensed her withdraw even further. He ran his
hands up and down her arms to stop her from tuning out and escaping in her
mind.
“You said good things don’t happen to you. You were terrified
something would happen that would ruin everything.”
When he clasped her face to force her to look at him, she closed her
eyes in defense. She was trembling, which he took as a good sign. The ice
was cracking. He nuzzled her, encouraging the breakdown.
“Those fears never went away. They’re still here now, controlling you,
trying to control me. This is a blessing, a fucking gift, and you’re treating it
like a curse.” His lips captured the first tear that fell. “I’m not going to let
you do it. I’m not going to let you destroy us. If you want to lie to Mom and
Dad, to your friends, to God, I don’t care, but you can’t lie to me. I know
you better than you know yourself.” He kissed the shell of her ear and
sighed in relief when she shivered. “Tell me you didn’t like what I did to
you. That you didn’t feel painfully alive. You begged me for more.”
She let out a choked sound.
“You want me, too,” he whispered harshly. “I had to force you to suck
me, but in the end, you wanted me to come down your throat.”
When she punched his shoulder, he sat back and saw she was glaring at
him through dripping eyes.
He softened and cupped her face. “Do you really think God is cruel
enough to make us want each other if we weren’t meant to be?”
“It’s a test to resist temptation.” Her voice was raspy from screaming.
“Or a test of our devotion to one another,” he countered.
She shook her head.
“Don’t compare what’s happening between us to King David’s affair
with Bathsheba or those half siblings,” he growled.
She pushed at his chest. “You’re my brother.”
“Not genetically.”
“Legally, we have the same parents.”
“Do the labels matter so much? What if I wasn’t your stepbrother?”
“But you are! And anyway, it’s still not okay! We’re not supposed to
have sex!”
“But getting married would make it right?”
Violet went ghost white.
“You…” she began in a strangled tone but was interrupted by the sound
of the garage door opening.
Violet shoved him hard enough to make him rock back on his heels. She
frantically wiped away her tears and then touched her hair and frowned as if
she’d slept through him braiding it for her. He got to his feet but stole a kiss
to put some color back in her face. He was on his way to the kitchen when
Mom came through the door.
“Hey, kids.”
“Hey, Mom.”
When Jesse kissed her cheek, he caught the relief that passed through
her eyes.
Mom clasped his face. “Are you okay?”
“Never better.”
Mom blinked. “Really?”
“Going to the park put things into perspective and helped me clear my
head.”
He heard Violet’s stifled gasp from the living room, but Mom didn’t
catch it. Mom followed him to the kitchen and perked up when she saw that
everything was done.
“You’re in pajamas already?” Mom asked, plucking at his sweatpants.
“We were sweaty and filthy, so we came home and washed up. Dinner
should be ready in a few minutes. You can shower if you want. I got this.”
Mom patted his chest. “Thanks, son. I think I will. Dad should be home
soon.”
That evening turned out to be busier than any of them anticipated.
Coach Rick didn’t give up. He called the landline to speak to his parents
again, and several teammates stopped by to confirm what they’d heard and
pleaded with Mom and Dad to change their minds. Jesse could see Isaac
teetering on his punishment, but he didn’t ask to be let off the hook.
When Isaac said he had to quit football, he’d been taken aback and
initially pissed before he realized the time he would have spent at practice
or at games could now be dedicated to Violet. If it came down to football or
Violet, he would choose her in a heartbeat. Ultimately, he saw this as
another reward for beating Tucker’s ass.
It took two hours for his friends and teammates to accept defeat. He
stood on the driveway as they let out dejected honks and drove away. Violet
was beside him. She’d been drawn out of the house by the girls who’d come
with their boyfriends or brothers. She was pale and subdued but functioning
well enough that the only question her friends asked had been whether she
was coming down with a cold.
Thanks to his behavior that morning and the parade of visitors, Mom
and Dad were mainly focused on him at dinner. He thought no one noticed
Violet’s listlessness and the fact that she took just a few bites of the taco he
made her until Mom rested her hand on Violet’s arm.
“Honey, are you all right?”
As Violet visibly struggled to come up with a response, he asked, “I
went too hard on you on the trail today, didn’t I?”
Violet gave a little jerk and gaped at him.
“You’re sore, aren’t you?”
He was pleased by the flicker of rebellion in her eyes and charmed by
the blush that hit her cheeks as she shook her head.
He sighed loudly. “Stubborn.”
Violet yelped when he picked her up and snapped, “I’m fine! Put me
down!”
“Don’t be proud,” he chided. “I’ll go easier on you next time.”
“You two,” Mom chuckled as he carried Violet to her bedroom.
He closed the door behind him and made his way to her bed. He flicked
back the covers before he set her down.
“Do you need Ibuprofen?”
“I said, I’m fine,” she said sullenly and stared at the ceiling.
He glanced at the closed door before he decided to climb in beside her.
Violet’s eyes nearly bugged out of her head.
“Are you crazy?” she hissed.
As he stretched out, she rolled to the other side and would have escaped
if he hadn’t dragged her back where she belonged.
“Let me go!”
“Hush,” he said as he gathered her against him and pressed her face
against his throat.
“What are you doing?” she demanded, voice muffled.
“Giving both of us what we need.”
“I don’t want this,” she said, wriggling, until he tightened his arms
around her.
She let out an angry huff and muttered under her breath. The feel of her
lips brushing against his skin made his blood sing. He ignored his body’s
reaction and focused on giving her the comfort that he hadn’t been able to
earlier in the day. He stroked her back, shoulders, and sides as he tried to
soothe the physical trauma he wrought. For long minutes, she was
completely rigid. Nearly fifteen minutes passed before she quivered and
unwillingly collapsed against him.
“I didn’t mean to hurt you,” he murmured.
“But you did.”
Her voice, thick with tears and tainted with fear, made him place kisses
along her hairline.
“I’m sorry, baby.”
“I’ve never seen that side of you before.”
“Me either.”
“You’ve changed.”
“So have you.”
She didn’t deny it. More time passed before the last of her tension
dissolved, leaving her boneless in his arms, just as he intended. He heard
the distant clink of silverware and plates as Mom and Dad cleared the table,
accurately deducing he wasn’t coming back. He cuddled Violet against him,
imagining a future where he could hold her like this without fear of being
reprimanded for doing what felt like the most natural thing in the world to
him. He thought she’d fallen asleep until her hand twisted in his shirt.
“I know this is special,” she whispered.
His heart leapt at her acknowledgement.
She eased back so she could see his face. Her wide, beseeching gaze
made his stomach twist.
“I don’t want to ruin what we have with sex,” she said in a rush.
He bit back a groan. “It won’t,” he began.
“Please, Jesse. Can we try to keep sex out of it and just see if…?”
Despite all he’d said, she was still in denial and trying to reverse the
clock to a time they could never return to. She wanted to keep him at arm’s
length and was instinctively trying to loosen the bonds that sex fortified and
strengthened every time he took her. He wouldn’t allow it. He had every
intention of exploiting their connection until they were so interlocked that
she was a part of him.
As he tried to think of the easiest way to let her down, she cupped his
cheek with a trembling hand.
Eyes sparkling with earnest tears, she said, “I don’t want to lose you.”
Nothing he said would reassure her that they were on the right path. She
believed God would punish her for continuing their relationship by
breaking them and the family apart. He had no intention of allowing either
of those things to happen, but only time would prove him right.
“You’ll never lose me,” he promised.
“You’ll try?” she pushed.
When he hesitated, her eyes welled with tears.
Pity made him say, “Yes.”
Even as her face lit with relief, he knew he wouldn’t keep his promise.

VIOLET.
2 MONTHS LATER.
Violet lay on the couch in the living room with Mom and Dad, who
sat in their individual recliners. Mom graded papers while Dad watched TV
and switched from the news to sports and then an old, black and white
sitcom.
“Isaac!” Mom said, exasperated. “Stop changing the channel. What
about Violet?”
“It’s okay. I’m used to it,” Violet murmured.
And she wasn’t watching anyway. When she was a child and had bad
dreams or wasn’t feeling good, she would sneak into Dad’s bedroom and
sleep on the floor. Just being near him banished the boogie man and made
her feel better. At seventeen, she was hoping their presence would have the
same magical effect, but the feeling of safety and comfort she was seeking
eluded her.
She tensed when she heard a key turn in the front door.
“Hey,” Jesse said as he entered with his backpack, gym bag, and a
sweater slung over one shoulder.
“There he is!” Mom said fondly. “How was basketball practice, son?”
“Long.” Jesse placed a kiss on top of Mom’s head. “I’m starved.”
“You should get cleaned up first. If you hurry, the food on the stove will
still be hot.”
Mom laughed as Jesse ran down the hallway to his room to shower.
“That saying about the way to a man’s heart is through his stomach is
true, isn’t it, Isaac?”
“Yup,” Dad said distractedly.
“What meal did I make that made you fall in love with me?” Mom
asked.
“Hot honey chicken cutlets.”
Mom grinned when she saw Violet watching her. “You’re set, honey.
You already know that recipe by heart.”
“She isn’t dating this year,” Dad said as he changed the channel.
“I know, but that doesn’t mean she can’t keep an eye out for the one,”
Mom said with a wink.
Violet gave Lynne a weak smile before she returned her attention to the
TV. She wasn’t looking for the one and if she stumbled upon him, and he
turned out to be as perfect as she’d always imagined, she’d tell him to find
someone else. Someone who could give him what he was looking for. She
had nothing to offer. The good qualities she’d once possessed had been
wrecked beyond repair.
Her hand fisted under the pillow. Jesse hadn’t kept his promise to keep
sex out of their relationship. He hadn’t even tried. Dad made her easy prey
by not allowing her to attend after school programs, go out on weekends,
and made Jesse her only option to commute to and from school. She was
basically a prisoner, and Jesse took full advantage.
He was relentless in his demands, yet nauseatingly gentle as he pillaged
and plundered. He took every opportunity to wring unwanted orgasms from
her and comforted her when self-loathing got the best of her, and she burst
into tears. Sometimes, when he felt a lick of remorse, he made promises
that he couldn’t keep for more than a few days. It was a hellish cycle of
hope and then crushing disappointment.
His sheer brazenness astounded her. He ambushed her in the most
unlikely places. School wasn’t a safe zone. At any moment, she could be
propelled into an empty computer lab or hustled under the bleachers so he
could have his way with her. The only time she was truly out of his reach
was in class, where she’d dozed off a few times. The stress was taking a toll
on her. Her grades were starting a downward trajectory that she needed to
get hold of before her parents saw her report card.
Jesse had easily worked his way back into their parents’ good graces by
utilizing the skills he picked up from the general contractor to fix things
around the house. Little did Mom and Dad know, he was repairing the holes
he’d made in his bedroom and covered everything up with a fresh coat of
paint. Violet couldn’t deny she’d been relieved when he got rid of the last
reminder from the day he took her virginity.
She was so on hypervigilant, she sensed Jesse enter the room seconds
before he spoke.
“Hey, Mom, how’s Raiden doing?” Jesse called.
Violet tracked Jesse’s voice into the kitchen, listened to the sound of
him opening the cabinet to get a bowl, and heard the clink of the lid being
set on the counter as he dug into the pot on the stove.
“He’s doing a little better, but you can see how exhausted and confused
he is,” Mom said sadly.
Mom gave them frequent updates on Raiden, a student whose parents
were in the midst of a nasty divorce, with the little boy caught in the
middle. Raiden was so miserable, he begged to stay at school instead of
going home.
“That’s too bad,” Jesse said. “I hoped after you talked to the mother,
things would improve.”
“No, she’s too self-involved to see what she’s doing to her son. Poor
Raiden. He hugs me at least ten times a day. It breaks my heart.”
“Maybe I can stop by and play basketball with him after school next
week,” Jesse offered.
Mom’s face lit up. “That would mean the world to him.”
Ambivalent emotions warred in Violet’s chest. How could Jesse be the
monster who had shoved her into the garage when she’d been stupid
enough to get a drink of water after their parents had gone to bed to have
his way with her, and the nice guy willing to take time out of his busy
schedule to play basketball with a child going through a hard time?
Jesse appeared with a bowl cradled in his large hand. She stared at the
TV, not acknowledging him or attempting to make space on the three-seater
couch she sprawled on. She’d hoped he would eat at the table, go to his
bedroom, or sit on the floor where he belonged. Instead, he stood there,
waiting.
As the awkward moment stretched, Mom started to rise from her
recliner.
“You can sit here, son.”
“No need,” Jesse said easily, and lifted Violet’s legs before he sat and
placed her feet on his lap.
Dad frowned at Violet, but she pretended not to notice. She hated that
Jesse had so easily outmaneuvered her. His poise under pressure astounded
her. Jesse had put them in some risky, compromising situations, but his
unruffled composure and well-mannered, caring facade immediately
disarmed authority figures who would have otherwise known he was up to
no good. Could she blame them for buying into his golden boy act? Even
she, who had seen him at his worst, still wanted to believe that the sweet,
supportive older brother she’d known and trusted was still in there
somewhere, despite dozens of incidents that proved otherwise.
She crawled to the other end of the couch and braced her pillow against
the couch arm before she resettled, tucking her legs up so she was no longer
touching him. She didn’t want to be near him, but she also didn’t want to be
alone with her gloomy thoughts. Since their parents were present, Jesse
would be on his best behavior.
“Allison brought you home?” Jesse asked her, ignoring the fact that she
had blatantly ignored him since he walked through the front door.
She inwardly bristled. It was none of his business who gave her a ride
home, but knowing their parents were listening, she had no choice but to
answer. “Yes.”
Jesse hadn’t been happy when Mom and Dad lifted the ban on after
school activities and going out on weekends last week. She leapt on her
reinstated freedom, hitching rides and hanging out with friends whenever
possible. Jesse was further foiled by the start of the basketball season. He’d
been strangely disinterested and reluctant to join, but Mom and Dad
insisted, probably out of guilt for the horrible football season his team had.
When Jesse finished his food, he set his empty bowl aside and shuffled
along the cushions. She tensed as he slipped beneath her oversized blanket.
Debating whether she could tolerate him or bail and go to her room, it was a
horrible shock when he grasped her foot and pulled it onto his lap. She
raised her head to snap at him, but he and Dad were deep in discussion
about the stats the sports announcer rattled off.
She tugged, but his iron grip wouldn’t let her go. She couldn’t believe
his gall. He knew she didn’t want him to touch her and did it anyway. He
was constantly pushing her and took as many liberties as possible with
others present because he knew she wouldn’t cause a scene. He was such an
asshole! She should jam her heel in his balls or crush his fingers with her
toes, but it wasn’t worth ruining the relaxed atmosphere.
She bared her teeth as his calloused thumbs ran along the bottom of her
foot. She bit her lip to stop herself from moaning when he hit a tender spot.
She hated how observant he was. When she stiffened, he lightened the
pressure and when she wriggled her toes, sensing she liked what he was
doing, he lingered. It was ironic that their silent communication was better
than their non-existent verbal communication. She had nothing to say to
him. He didn’t care how she felt or what she wanted. She learned what he
said meant nothing. How could he be so in tune with her in one area and
completely deaf and dumb to her wants and needs in others?
“This is nice,” Mom said, surveying them with a smile.
It was rare for all of them to be together on a Friday evening. The only
reason she hadn’t gone to the mall with Marie and Allison was because she
thought Jesse was going out with Brody and Blaine after practice.
“We should start this weekend off right,” Mom said excitedly. “Anyone
up for a movie?”
Knowing Jesse had to be up bright and early to work with the general
contractor, Violet assumed he would decline. She was annoyed when he
said, “Sure. What should we watch?”
She didn’t offer a suggestion, since she wouldn’t be paying attention.
They debated for a couple of minutes before settling on some action movie.
As Mom turned off the lights and closed the blinds tight, so the only light
came from the screen, Violet tried to remember the last movie night they
had. She used to love huddling under the covers, eating popcorn mixed with
assorted candies. The memories were tattered and slightly out of focus, like
they belonged to someone else.
It was the same four people sitting in the same room in front of the TV,
but the contentment and sense of security she used to feel when surrounded
by family had been replaced with a feeling of stark alienation even though
Mom and Dad were mere feet away. It was like sitting in front of a fire, but
not feeling the warmth of the blaze…
A soft snore made Violet shift her head. She wasn’t surprised to see
Lynne had fallen asleep before the movie finished its opening credits.
“She always does that,” Violet said with a shake of her head.
“She works hard. The moment she lets herself relax, she’s dead to the
world,” Dad said. “Let her sleep.”
Despite herself, Violet found herself drawn into the movie, which was
non-stop action from the opening chase scene. She was so engrossed in the
story that it took a while for her to realize that the massage had stopped, and
she was lying there, relaxed and comfortable, with her feet propped on her
tormentor’s lap.
The moment she tried to pull away, Jesse gripped her shin. He squeezed,
telling her to stay as she was. How dare he? She tipped onto her back to
kick him with her free foot and went rigid when his hand brushed over her
bare thigh.
The TV screen went black as the main character dropped into a tunnel,
plunging the living room into darkness at the same time that Jesse’s hand
slid into the leg of her pajama shorts and cupped her between her legs. She
jerked as if she’d been electrocuted. Her confidence that he wouldn’t make
a move in front of their parents shattered into a million pieces. The sound of
the character cursing and pounding the wall in frustration concealed Violet’s
uncoordinated, frantic bid to get away. She did an awkward backstroke like
a swimmer as panic seared her insides.
An explosion on screen briefly illuminated the room. Her head snapped
between both parents. Their recliners flanked the couch but were slightly in
front of them and angled toward the TV. Mom’s head was sharply tilted,
indicating she was still asleep, while Dad perched on the edge of his seat,
riveted by what was happening on screen. If Dad looked at them, the plush,
oversized blanket draped over her body and Jesse’s lap would conceal what
he was doing, but… How could Jesse be touching her while they were in
the room? Was he insane?
Jesse brought her attention back to him when his thumb slid inside her
satin underwear. In the poor light, she saw Jesse’s head turned toward her.
He wasn’t even trying to pretend he was interested in the movie. She
strained to get away, but when he began to fondle her clit, she started
fighting in earnest. When she savagely yanked on her captive leg, he flicked
her underwear aside and sheathed his middle finger inside of her.
Her gasp was lost in a hail of deafening gunfire on screen. Out of the
corner of her eye, she saw Lynne sit up. Dad snagged the remote to turn
down the volume.
“Too loud?” Dad asked.
“A bit, but that’s why we have those speakers, right? To get the full
effect?” Lynne yawned as she rose and stretched.
Violet clawed the back of Jesse’s hand jammed between her legs. He
made no move to withdraw, even as Lynne started toward them.
Lightheaded with horror, Violet closed her eyes as Lynne kissed Jesse’s
cheek. As her body tightened in reaction to Mom’s nearness, the tip of
Jesse’s finger curled, making her break out in goosebumps.
“Vi’s asleep?” Mom murmured.
“Mm hmm,” Jesse said distractedly, as if he was engrossed in the
movie. “She fell asleep not long after you.”
It took everything she had not to react as Mom leaned over her, so close
to where her son’s fingers were buried inside her. Biting panic engulfed her
as Mom tenderly brushed back her hair.
“Sweet dreams, my sweet girl,” Mom murmured before she moved
away.
“My bed is calling me,” Mom said around a jaw cracking yawn as she
kissed Dad’s cheek.
As Mom shuffled down the hallway, Jesse called, “Sleep tight,” even as
he withdrew his finger and smeared what it was coated with on her clit and
rubbed.
A silent battle commenced with Jesse trying to conquer her body while
she desperately tried to retreat. When his grip slipped on the leg keeping her
captive, she lunged for the lamp on the side table and snapped it on. As light
flooded the room, Dad turned his head and squinted at her.
“Is it okay if I leave the light on?” she panted as she dragged herself to
the opposite end of the couch, safely out of Jesse’s reach.
Even though he clearly wished otherwise, Dad nodded and turned back
to the movie. She buried her face on the arm rest for a moment, grappling
for control over her body, before her eyes cut to Jesse. Her stomach flipped
when he put his middle finger in his mouth. Damn him!
She shot to her feet and froze when Jesse began to rise as well. She had
no doubt that he would follow her. He wouldn’t have touched her with
Mom and Dad present unless he was already past the point of no return.
Knowing the movie would conceal the sounds of whatever he planned to do
to her, she retook her seat. A muscle ticked in his jaw.
She adjusted her pants before she sat as far from him as possible and
huddled in the circle of light to keep the wolf at bay. She ran shaking
fingers through her hair and tried to ignore the telling movements under the
blanket bunched on Jesse’s lap. Was he actually going to…?
When Jesse shot to his feet, Dad’s head whipped around.
“I have to be up early for work,” Jesse stated.
Dad nodded. “I’m surprised you stayed up this long,” he said with a
glance at his watch.
Jesse grunted as Dad turned back to the screen. He stood there, staring
at her for so long, that Dad turned around again.
“You need something, son?”
“No,” Jesse said and stalked down the hallway to his bedroom.
She tucked her legs to the side and dragged the blanket around her once
more, trembling. She couldn’t believe he just did that. He pushed the
boundaries, but he’d never gone this far. Did he have no shame or scruples?
She clamped her thighs together and ignored the low throb between her
legs. She hated the way he’d conditioned her body to respond to him, to
yearn for him. A glance at Dad quelled the desire Jesse tried to ignite.
Would Dad believe her if she told him that the son he was so proud of
was doing the unthinkable to her? Her chest tightened. Although Dad hadn’t
brought it up since it happened, she knew he still blamed her for Jesse
putting Tucker in the hospital. Dad had absolved Jesse, but not her. There
was something in his eyes when he looked at her that told her he suspected
she was no longer innocent. If she got up the courage to tell him what Jesse
was doing, and he didn’t believe her or worse, accused her of being the
problem, it would kill her. She turned off the light as her face crumpled.
“You turning in too, Vi?” Dad asked without turning to look at her.
“No. I’m staying.”
Her shaky tone went unnoticed as the main character made an
impossible, stylish leap from a helicopter.
How many times had she considered confiding in a friend, school
counselor, youth pastor, or therapist who was sworn to secrecy? But who
would believe her? Even she couldn’t believe what was happening. The
only person who would probably take her word for it was the one person
who avoided her like the plague. Tucker had been on the receiving end of a
temper that no one even knew Jesse possessed. Tucker had returned to
school and explained his absence by spinning some tale about being
approached by a record label. His return had briefly stirred up everyone’s
interest in her again, but this time, she didn’t care. She had bigger problems
to deal with—namely, her stepbrother, who everyone idolized and admired
and thought wouldn’t hurt a fly.
By the time the movie ended, she was once more stretched out on the
couch with her head on the arm rest. Dad glanced at her and, when he saw
she was still awake, flicked through a few channels before he settled on
reruns of, I Love Lucy. When she was a kid, Dad only allowed her to watch
old movies and shows so he wouldn’t have to worry about anything explicit
being shown.
They chuckled together as they watched Lucy’s antics. When the
episode ended, Dad got to his feet.
“You’re going to stay up?” he asked.
“Yeah.”
He came over and set the remote by the lamp so she could easily reach
it.
“Night, kiddo.”
“Night, Dad,” she echoed.
She listened to him shuffle down the hallway as another episode began.
She was tired but couldn’t bring herself to go to her room. She turned off
the lamp because the bright light was making her eyes water. She cocked
her head when she heard footsteps making their way to the living room.
Assuming Dad wanted a drink of water or had forgotten something, she
looked up when a dark figure rounded the couch. When she realized it
wasn’t Dad, she opened her mouth to scream. Jesse lunged at her, clapping
a hand over her lips before she could utter a sound.
He leaned down and rested his forehead against hers as he murmured, “I
can’t go another night without you.”
Even as she prepared to bite his palm, he dragged her to the middle of
the couch and flipped her onto her stomach. The blanket was tossed to the
floor before her bottoms were yanked to her knees. Even as she turned her
head to the side to catch her breath, Jesse was already sinking inside her.
She clawed the cushions and kicked her feet as her body struggled to adjust.
“Shh,” he soothed as he came down on top of her.
With her legs clamped together, he felt impossibly large, and though she
was wet, it wasn’t enough. The couch absorbed her groan as he withdrew
and then pushed for more territory.
“Good girl. Almost there,” he praised and ignored her furious hiss.
“God, you feel so good, Vi. So perfect.”
“What the hell are you doing? They could walk in any minute.”
“I jacked off twice and still tossed and turned. My hand won’t do. I need
you. I need this. I’m going crazy. I can’t escape even in sleep because I
dream of you.”
His hands skated down her arms until he reached her hands. Before she
could pull away, he twined their fingers together.
“Do you know what it’s like, never having a moment’s peace? To want
something so badly, you’ll do anything to possess it?”
He shuddered and buried his face in her hair as he sheathed himself
completely.
“Thank you,” he said fervently.
“You’re sick.”
His tongue dipped into her ear before he breathed, “So are you. The
difference between us is, I accept it.”
She screwed her eyes shut as he began to thrust, stabbing deep, making
her toes curl.
“This doesn’t have to be sick. This doesn’t have to be twisted. It can be
beautiful if you’d let it. If you stopped fighting and let us be.” His fingers
tightened around hers. “I can feel you milking me and getting wetter. You
love this.”
She buried her face in the cushions as she tried to deny what he was
saying, but her body wasn’t under her command. It was under his, and it
responded to him, bathing him in honey, welcoming him, while her mind
did everything in its power to block out what was happening.
“You’ve been dodging me all week, denying me, denying yourself. Why
do you do that? You want me to prove how much I want you? How I’m lost
without you?”
Her stomach flipped as he released her hands and dropped off the side
of the couch and pulled her bottom half with him. He positioned her so she
was on her knees on the carpet with him behind her. Unfortunately, her face
landed in the damp spot she’d just made on the cushions.
With a grimace, she straightened. Jesse immediately took advantage of
the position to slide his hands beneath her top. He stroked her stomach and
gripped her breasts as he gave her body time to adjust to him, to prepare for
what was coming. One hand plucked her clit. To her disgust, she rested her
head on his shoulder and spread her legs, giving him more access. He
obliged while he sucked on her neck.
“Tell me you want this,” he said darkly.
That cut through the sexual haze. Awareness crept back in. She yanked
on his arm to get his hand off her breast, but all it got her was a nipple pinch
that suffused her with more unwanted heat.
“Admit it. Just this once,” he begged.
When she remained silent, his teeth sank into her shoulder.
“So stubborn,” he growled and shoved her face into cushions that
smelled of her weakness before his control disintegrated.
He blanketed her body with his as he began to move with hard, sure
strokes. The only sound she could hear aside from Jesse’s uneven breaths
was Lucy wailing on the television. Between the hard, rhythmic smacking
of their flesh and the TV, it was impossible to hear anyone approach. She
prayed Mom and Dad were sound asleep as Jesse straightened and hauled
her back with every thrust, so she took every inch, growling like an animal,
desperately trying to meld them together.
Sensing he was close, she compounded her sins by touching herself to
reach her own orgasm.
“Yeah, baby. Come with me,” he said harshly as he picked up his pace.
When he climaxed, he folded over her, gasping her name. She ignored
him as she chased her own orgasm, which was just out of reach. Jesse
brushed her hand aside, strumming her clit, and encouraged her to impale
herself on him until she shattered. He held her as she trembled, first with
elation and, less than a minute later, with the familiar slap of shame and
guilt. No matter what she did to foil him, they always ended here.
Jesse withdrew slowly. She pressed her thighs together and wasn’t
surprised when his hand slipped through his semen, pushing it back in
before spreading it over her ass and lower back.
When he got to his feet, her mind urged her to get up, dress, and clean
herself, but she couldn’t move. She sensed Jesse leave the room and heard
his bedroom door close seconds later. Even as the studio audience laughed,
Violet wept.

VIOLET.
FOUR MONTHS LATER.
Thumbs hooked under her backpack straps; Violet stood at the end
of the driveway. Luck was on her side. Mom left early this morning to
decorate her classroom for spring, allowing Violet to change up her
commute without Mom asking questions.
As her neighbor passed with his dog, he nodded to Violet while also
giving her a slightly puzzled look that made her blush. Embarrassed, but
determined to follow through with her plan, she stared at the end of the
street, willing her ride to appear and save her from going with…
“What are you doing?”
She stiffened, but didn’t turn around to address the bane of her
existence.
“I’m waiting,” she said, stating the obvious.
“I see that. Waiting for what?”
“I’m catching the bus to school.”
She was grateful they were in plain view of their neighbors who were
heading to work or taking out the trash. It meant that she had countless
witnesses if Jesse did something foul. He wouldn’t, of course. He saved his
reprehensible behavior for when they were behind closed doors. In public,
his manners were impeccable.
“You’re not catching the bus.”
She tightened her grip on her straps. “Mom already left for work. She
won’t know we didn’t ride together.”
“But Dad will. He asked me what you’re doing out here.”
She whirled and spotted her father standing in the window with his
coffee mug in hand. Damn. She hadn’t thought to look in the garage to see
if his truck was there. She assumed he was at work.
“You want to tell him what’s going on or are you going to get in the
car?”
Jesse’s taunt made her vision bleed to red. He asked that question like
he had nothing to hide, as if his future didn’t depend on her keeping their
secret. He should be kissing her ass, not provoking her. The fact that he was
so certain she wouldn’t tell anyone made her so angry, she couldn’t speak.
She wanted to. She should! But, as miserable as she was, she couldn’t bring
herself to get help.
On days like today, when Jesse pushed her to her breaking point, her
mind played out every possible outcome. None of them ended well. If she
released her pain, it would spread like a disease, infecting her family,
rocking their church, and sending shockwaves through their tight-knit
community. Nothing would ever be the same. Better to compartmentalize.
To suppress her inner turmoil and believe that Jesse would come to his
senses and stop. Also, confiding in someone meant explaining what was
happening to her and… she just couldn’t. That would make it all too real.
“Come on, Vi.”
Jesse had the audacity to look exasperated with her, as if she had no
grounds to be upset about what he did to her fifteen minutes ago.
“Violet?”
She broke eye contact with Jesse to see Dad standing on the front steps.
“Is something wrong?”
Bottled up emotions tore up her insides, making her eyes water.
Dad’s expression darkened. “What is it?”
Her mouth worked before she finally got out, “Jesse pissed me off. I
want to catch the bus instead of riding with him.”
Dad blinked, clearly surprised. She and Jesse rarely quarreled. There
had been no need to in the past.
“Jesse?” Dad prompted with a frown.
“I’ll make it up to her.”
Her skin prickled as Jesse gave that ominous promise.
“Avoiding your problems isn’t going to solve anything,” Dad
admonished, shaking his head. “I taught you better than that. Settle it on the
way to school. I’m sure Jesse didn’t mean to upset you.”
The pressure in her chest increased. A scream vibrated at the base of her
throat.
Dad tossed Jesse a set of keys. “Take the truck. I need the SUV today.”
Dad gave her a level look. “Be good.”
The subtle rebuke made it clear that he thought she was overreacting
and being childish. Dad walked into the house. Several seconds later, the
garage rolled up to reveal the truck that was almost as old as she was. It
took a minute for her to have enough control to stalk to the truck instead of
having a meltdown. Jessie didn’t fetch his bag until she was settled in the
passenger seat.
She buckled up and twisted her hand in the dark blue seat belt as the
yellow school bus she’d been waiting for cruised past. All she wanted was a
moment’s respite from him, but it seemed like the world was conspiring
against her.
Jesse didn’t say a word as he started the truck and reversed out of the
garage. Silence reined between them as they left their neighborhood. Her
stomach was tight as a fist.
“Did I hurt you?”
He meant physically, but he didn’t have to leave a bruise on her skin to
hurt her. Marks made in passion would fade. It was the hundreds of
invisible, razor-thin emotional cuts he inflicted that she knew would scar
and haunt her for the rest of her life.
“Does it matter?”
He ran a hand through his hair. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. That wasn’t
my intention.”
“What was your intention?”
A muscle ticked in his jaw. “You know.”
To scratch his itch before he started his day? She didn’t fight back when
he cornered her in the bathroom, ushered her into the tub, and pinned her
against the tiles to ravage her. She didn’t resist when he pushed her to her
knees and fucked her mouth. It was only after he’d left her kneeling in the
tub with her face dripping, and she heard Mom singing in the kitchen, that
she snapped out of her daze and retched.
She wasn't sure why this morning was different from the others. He’d
done far more demeaning things, but today it struck her how truly warped
their relationship had become. The fact that they hadn’t exchanged a word
during that whole encounter, and he left the moment he achieved his goal,
made her realize he’d truly turned into Amnon. He didn’t loathe her, but he
was addicted to using her to slake his lust and didn’t care how that impacted
her. Their relationship has turned into a sour, tangled, depraved mess.
Jesse had changed. He no longer cajoled. He no longer petted and
stroked to prepare her for him. The affection she’d come to expect from him
had vanished. She was just a body to him. No one seemed to notice that his
smile wasn’t the same, that he rarely laughed, and there was a hardness to
him that hadn’t been there before. When they were alone, and he wasn’t
wearing a mask, she was chilled by what she saw in his eyes. Her brother
was gone and in his place was a stranger, one capable of anything.
When Jesse took the wrong exit, she gave him a sharp glance. “Where
are we going?”
“For a drive.”
Her blood turned to ice. “No!”
“We need to talk.”
Talk? That was something they no longer did. Their commutes to and
from school were done in complete silence. The only time they casually
conversed was while hanging out with mutual friends or around their
parents. If they were alone, Jesse was too focused on getting her on her
back to ask about her day or hopes and dreams.
“We have nothing to talk about.”
His hand flexed on the wheel. “We do.”
She flung her hand in front of her. “So, talk! Why are we leaving
Austin?”
“I don’t want us to be interrupted, and I need to clear my head.”
“We’re going to be late for school.”
“We’ll make it back in time. We aren’t going far.”
She twisted her hand in the folds of her light sweater as they traded the
congested, six lane freeways for a two-lane highway. At this hour, everyone
was headed into the city for work and school, while she and Jesse sped in
the opposite direction.
Despite Jesse’s reassurance that they weren’t going far, they were going
further than she was comfortable with. She considered calling Mom and
Dad to tell them Jesse had lost his mind, when he finally slowed and turned
off the main highway onto an unmarked dirt road.
“Where are we?”
“We’re almost there,” he yelled as they rattled down the pitted road.
“Almost where?” she demanded, clutching the door handle.
“Here,” he said as they rounded a bend.
Trees gave way to rolling flatlands covered in a blanket of bluebonnets
that stretched as far as the eye could see. Taking photos amidst the
wildflowers was a rite of passage for locals who flocked to every park,
field, and even along the highway in hopes of getting the perfect shot.
As Jesse pulled off the road, she rolled down her window to admire the
cerulean beauties. Until that moment, she hadn’t realized what a gorgeous
day it was. The morning chill was giving way to what promised to be a
warm spring day. Birds chirped to one another. There was no sound of cars
or people, just a lone farmhouse in the distance. The scene was so idyllic, it
looked like a painting.
“Logan’s aunt lives at the end of this lane,” Jesse said. “I thought you’d
enjoy seeing this.”
“It’s stunning,” she murmured as she closed her eyes and tipped her face
to the sun.
Her worries about getting to school on time and why they were here
dissolved. Minutes passed in blessed silence. When she opened her eyes,
she blinked back tears. She wasn’t sure why. She braced her chin on her
arms and stared at a sea of blue so dense, she imagined she could swim in
it.
“Violet.”
Her bubble of tranquility popped. Tension crept back in. Anxiety stole
the sun’s warmth from her face.
“What?” she said woodenly.
“I’m sorry if I went too far this morning.”
The clean taste of toothpaste was canceled out by the aftertaste of
betrayal, which tasted like bitter grapefruit. “But that isn’t going to stop you
from doing it again, is it?”
A pause and then, “No.”
She swung around to face him as her chest quaked. “You have to stop!
You can’t do this anymore! Don’t you see what it’s doing to us?”
His expression was pained as he held his hands out to her in
supplication. “I’ve tried, Vi. I—”
“Try harder!” she bellowed.
His Adam’s apple bobbed as he swallowed. “I swear I am. But the more
I resist, the more I try to push it down…” His hand balled into a fist. “The
worse it is when I lose control.”
“This isn’t normal, Jesse. It’s wrong!”
His expression hardened. “It could be right if you’d...” He looked away
from her, down the empty road.
“If I what? Gave into you? Did whatever you wanted? Isn’t that what
I’ve been doing? What more do you want?”
“I want you to want me back!”
His bellow made her heart stop.
“You think it’s enough to have your body?” he asked harshly. “To have
you give into me?” He shook his head. “I thought that would be enough,
too, but it isn’t. I hate the way you look at me. The way you stiffen up when
I touch you when I know a part of you wants it.” His hand slashed through
the air. “Needs it just as much as I do. I want you to let yourself want me
back, Vi, and stop punishing us.”
“I don’t want you.” Her voice wasn’t as adamant as she intended.
His eyes narrowed. “Don’t lie. It isn't always force. Most of the time,
you’re wet before I even touch you. Three days ago, you were rocking back
so hard on my dick, I had to brace myself. What—”
“That’s my body, not me!” she shrieked.
“Your body,” he repeated in a flat tone.
“Yes!”
He stared at her for a full minute before he said, “You’re not going to
give in, are you?”
“Did I fight you this morning?” she asked waspishly.
He dismissed that with a wave of his hand, as if it was of no
consequence. Rage licked the walls of her mind.
“I mean, you’re not going to admit what’s between us,” he clarified.
“What’s between us is gone! You destroyed it!”
His hand, still on the steering wheel, went white as he gripped it,
making the veins on the back of his hand stand out.
“I didn’t destroy it,” he said roughly. “I embraced it, surrendered to it.
Your fear of change, of Mom and Dad and God made this into something
bad, but it isn’t. This is a goddamn gift.”
His eyes gleamed with zeal, sending a trickle of alarm through her.
“Dad said what isn’t meant to be, God won’t allow. God isn’t stopping
us from being together. He would have intervened in some fashion by now,
don’t you think? No matter what you do, God keeps pushing you toward
me. He wouldn’t even let you catch the bus! He brought us here so we
could talk. Why can’t you see that you’re the only thing stopping us from
being everything we’re meant to be? Of being happy?”
“Don’t you dare use God to justify your behavior. The only reason
you’ve gotten away with it is because you’re so good at fooling people, and
I’m too weak to...” Her throat constricted as despair and rage warred within
her. “You…” Eyes burning, she bowed her head as she desperately tried to
regain control.
“It’s not because you’re weak. You haven’t told anyone because you
love me.”
Her head jerked up. “Love?” She could barely get the word out. How
dare he say that to her?
“You love me,” he stated with such unshakeable confidence that she
wanted to scratch his eyes out. “Deep down, you know we’re supposed to
be together. You wouldn’t respond to anyone else the way you do to me.”
“That’s not true.” The moment the words left her mouth, she regretted
it.
“What’s not true?”
His voice was calm, but she knew he was anything but.
She licked dry lips and couldn’t resist casting a nervous glance around,
but there wasn’t a soul in sight. “I think we should go.”
“What’s not true?” he repeated.
When she didn’t speak, he leaned toward her.
“It’s not true that you only respond to me?”
She plucked at her jeans. He reached across the bench seat and gripped
her chin, eyes glittering with the threat of violence.
“If I find out you allowed anyone to touch you, I’d kill them.”
“No one has!” She swatted at his hand, which only held her tighter. “I’m
not allowed to date, and I don’t want anyone, including you! In fact, I think
you should start dating again.”
“Date.”
His voice was flat and emotionless.
“Yes, date. Have sex with other girls.” She lifted her chin in challenge.
“If I loved you, if I believed we were supposed to be together, would I push
you toward someone—anyone else?”
The hand on her chin fell away. She was about to reach for her
backpack to retrieve her phone when she saw his eyes glistening with tears.
Her stomach flipped. She couldn’t remember the last time she’d seen him
cry. She was horrified by the overwhelming need to apologize and comfort
him. What the hell was wrong with her? He’d hurt her immeasurably and
broken promise after promise. Why the hell should she care that something
she said had finally gotten through to him? She shouldn’t care.
But she did.
“You hate me,” he said quietly.
She swallowed hard.
“If you hate me, say it.”
She opened her mouth, but nothing came out. Her voice deserted her
when she needed it most.
His expression softened. “You want to hate me, but you can’t.”
“Stay back,” she ordered as he reached for her.
“I’m not going to hurt you,” he crooned and gripped her leg and tugged,
stretching her out on the bench seat with him hovering over her.
He ignored the hands that braced against his chest and rested his
forehead against hers.
“You don’t want me with someone else.”
“Y-yes, I do!” she choked.
“Okay, baby,” he said, clearly humoring her.
“I really do!” she insisted as he stroked her hair. “I’m serious. Get what
you need from someone else. I’ll interview them! I know what kinky shit
you’re into. I can find a skanky—”
His mouth covered hers. The kiss was hard and punishing, but when she
stopped struggling, it immediately gentled. He began to kiss her tenderly,
reverently, as he hadn’t done for weeks. It was a shock, considering how
he’d used her less than an hour ago. Her body quivered in delight, starved
for affection and connection.
She tried to escape mentally, but Jesse wasn’t rushing. He wasn’t
rushing to get off or worried about being discovered. His tongue tangled
lazily with hers and enticed her to engage. She was drawn in by the taste of
something sweet. What was that? Eager to erase the bitterness in her mouth,
she allowed her tongue to dance with his and ignored his pleased hum. He’d
eaten an apple for breakfast. Curiosity appeased, she tried to disengage, but
Jesse didn’t allow it.
He kept her mouth busy as he kissed her ten different ways—indulgent,
deep, teasing, arousing. She couldn’t keep up and was further distracted
when his hand slipped beneath her sweater and covered her breast. By the
time he raised his head and allowed her to catch her breath, her mind was
spinning.
“You want me to kiss other girls like this?” he murmured as his lips
drifted over her face.
She tried to gather her wits as he bunched her sweater under her chin.
Even as she registered the cool chill on her bare skin, Jesse tucked the cup
of her bra beneath her left breast. When he flicked her nipple with his
tongue, she jerked like she’d been lashed with a whip.
“I love when your breasts get sensitive close to your period,” he said
before he latched onto her nipple.
He pinned her arms to the seat as she hissed and arched and bit back the
urge to beg for mercy. It wouldn’t make a difference to him. It never did.
Despite his claims that God was on his side, she refused to believe it and
prayed for divine intervention. Maybe the people in the farmhouse would
get curious about why they were parked here and come investigate. Or
perhaps a passerby would peek in, thinking they had car trouble or
something had gone wrong. She strained to hear the rumble of a car, but all
she could hear was the wet sounds of Jesse suckling and her own pathetic
whimpering.
“You love this,” he said raggedly, and turned his head from side to side,
so her nipple dragged along his lips. “I could do this to you all day. You’re
so beautiful. A meadow of bluebonnets is nothing compared to you.” He
nuzzled her breast as he muttered, “I had girls offer me everything. I
couldn’t bring myself to take, even though I was desperate for relief. I’d
rather be tortured in your presence and have you see me as a brother, then
sink my dick into someone and try to picture your face while I’m with her. I
need the real thing. I need you, Violet. No one else will do.”
She tipped her head back to look out the open window and tried to
follow the progress of slow-moving clouds as Jesse moved to her other
breast. When she couldn’t take anymore, she kicked her legs in frustration.
“Jesse!”
He eased the pressure and finally released her breast. He admired how
puckered and swollen it was and peppered it with kisses before he buried
his face between them.
“This has been hell.”
His voice was muffled against her skin as he stroked her sides.
“I don’t want it to be like this between us.”
But it was, and there was no going back to the way it had been. Maybe
in the beginning, they could have restored their relationship, but they’d
gone too far. Their bond was so mangled, she couldn’t imagine them having
a relationship that was even remotely normal or healthy.
“I didn’t intend to do this,” he said, kissing the side of her breast. “I
brought you here so we could talk about the future.”
She stiffened. “What future?”
Jesse lifted his head and searched her face. “Ours.”
She gaped at him.
“I’m going to graduate soon. I wanted to talk about what we should—”
“We?”
She shoved him hard enough to make him blink.
“Get off me!” she snapped.
He sighed. “Calm down.”
“You calm down! Get the hell off me before I scream my head off.”
It wasn’t a huge threat, considering the isolated setting, but Jesse rose
and sat behind the wheel as she shot up and hastily fixed her bra and yanked
her sweater down.
“There’s nothing to discuss with me. You’re going to graduate and go
off to college in another city or, better yet, out of state. I’ll finish school and
go my own way. Our futures aren’t the same.”
He stared at her, expression unreadable.
“There is no we or our or us. What we had, what we were, is gone.
You…” She swallowed hard, eyes stinging with tears. “You hurt me more
than anyone else. I trusted you. I never thought you of all people would
ever…”
When he reached for her, she recoiled and wrapped her arms around
herself.
“I want this to be over. I need it to be over.” A tear slid down her cheek.
“I need you gone.”
“You don’t mean that,” he whispered.
He was clearly gutted. She ruthlessly stomped out the flurry of weak
emotions that told her she’d gone far enough, that it wasn’t the Christian
way to repay evil with evil. She was supposed to overcome evil with good,
but she didn’t have that in her. All she had was anger. Lots of it. Months of
suppressed rage and shame and helplessness erupted, spewing like hot lava.
She had to get it out, to let him know how she saw him, and that there was
no future where they were together.
“What’s between us isn’t a gift, it’s poison,” she said hoarsely. “It’s
corrupt and rotten, and nothing good has come from it. You think if it felt so
good, if we were meant to be, that I would spend an hour scrubbing my
body every time you touch me and still never feel clean?”
He went very still. She hardened her heart against the anguish creeping
into his expression. This was her moment to end this once and for all, and
she was going to see it through, even if it destroyed them both in the
process.
“I hate that I can’t look Dad in the eye. I hate that I have to watch every
word I say because I’m terrified I’ll let something slip. I hate that you were
my first and that you conditioned my body to respond to you.”
She trembled under the tremendous, crushing weight on her shoulders.
“You think what’s stopping me from telling someone is love, but it isn’t
love for you. It’s love for Lynne. Knowing what you are would destroy
her.”
“What am I?”
A tear slipped down her cheek as she said, “You’re a monster.”
His expression went blank, his vulnerability and agony vanishing so
quickly, she wasn’t sure it had been there at all. Silence reined. A bird
swooped in front of the truck before it flapped away, chirping gaily. A
breeze caused fine tendrils of hair to slide across her face.
“Say it, Vi.”
She knew what he wanted to hear and finally had the strength to.
“You’re right. I don’t hate you.” For just a moment, she saw hope flash
in his eyes before she finished, “I feel nothing for you at all.”
He didn’t move a muscle, but the hairs on her arms stood up as
something evil and inhuman stared out of Jesse’s eyes. She got her first
glimpse of the demon that lurked within him the day Jesse took her by the
river. Recently, she’d begun to see him more frequently, as Jesse was ruled
by his lustful appetites. The demon that used to possess him at night was
now visible in broad daylight. He and Jesse were now one.
“I really tried, Violet,” Jesse said ruefully, lips curved in a mocking
smile as his eyes burned with wrath. “I tried for you, but I guess it wasn’t
good enough.”
She clutched the door handle, heart pumping, as he cocked his head,
examining her clinically.
“Telling a monster you feel nothing for him isn’t very smart,” he
pointed out.
She stopped breathing.
“It gives him no incentive not to act like one.”
Even as he reached for her, she shoved the door open and fell out of the
truck. This was all horrifically familiar, but this time, she knew what he was
capable of. Even as she scrambled to her feet and reached for her backpack
to grab her cell phone, he slid across the seat after her.
For a split second, she considered trying to reason with him, but a
glimpse of the bloodlust carved into his face convinced her fleeing was her
only option. She plunged into the field of bluebonnets, her aim the lone
farmhouse in the distance. She waved her hands, hoping someone was
looking out of the window and would realize something was terribly wrong.
She would have screamed in hopes that anyone within earshot would come
to the rescue, but she didn’t have time to haul in a breath when she could
hear him gaining ground behind her. He was an athlete. Strong, fast. She
would never make it.
Even as the thought crossed through her mind, Jesse tackled her from
behind. The impact sent her sprawling in a patch of fluffy bluebonnets that
cushioned her fall. She scrambled on her hands and feet, trying to get away.
When Jesse hauled her back, Dad’s training kicked in. She balled her fist
and swung with all her might. Jesse dropped like a stone when she punched
him in the ear.
Breath ragged, she continued on. As she stumbled through the
wildflowers, she glanced back at the road. Her stomach lurched when she
realized how far away she was. The farmhouse was her only hope. Out of
the corner of her eye, she saw Jesse straighten. Panic gave her extra
strength. She ran full out, faster than she ever had. It was life or death. She
could do this.
She was close enough now to make out more details of the house. The
porch had a swing and pots of pink and yellow flowers. Whoever lived
there was a good person. They would help her if they were home. God,
please help me, she begged. Prove Jesse wrong. Save me. If You do, I swear
I’ll… she was struck down again before she could strike a bargain with
God.
Jesse took the brunt of the fall and this time, kept his arms around her
instead of knocking her off balance. They rolled. He pinned her clawed
hand to the ground and leaned over her, gold cross swinging. His eyes were
alight. She would never forget the strange formation of clouds dotting the
sky, being hemmed in by cheery bluebonnets, and the look on Jesse’s face
as he looked down at her.
Time stopped.
“Jesse?” she panted.
He leaned down, kissed her forehead, and murmured, “Lord, forgive me
for what I’m about to do.”
Violet lay on a bed of crushed wildflowers. She was naked. She
knew that should bother her, but she couldn’t find the will to care. Nothing
mattered. Not anymore.
A figure appeared in her line of sight. She didn’t bother focusing on
Jesse. Instead, she admired a cloud that resembled an elephant head. That
was more interesting than anything Jesse had to say. She hadn’t been honest
when she said she didn’t feel anything for him, but it had been a selffulfilling prophecy because now she really didn’t. He’d given her glimpses
of the monster within, but he proved beyond a shadow of a doubt that her
brother was truly gone. They could never go back to what they’d been.
Ever.
Jesse pulled her into a sitting position so he could slip a shirt over her
head. Gently, he pulled her to her feet. The shirt was so large, it covered her
to mid-thigh. When he crouched to pick her up, she hung lifelessly over his
shoulder and spotted her torn peach-colored sweater and stained jeans
clutched in his hand. She closed her eyes as her stomach rocked.
Her head spun as he settled her in the passenger seat of the truck.
Automatically, she pulled the seatbelt across her chest and clicked it in. She
pressed her feet together, noting that she was missing a sock. She stared
down the dirt road that hadn’t brought one car across their path.
Jesse opened the glove box in front of her and pulled out one of Dad’s
red paisley bandanas. He splashed it with water before he began to clean
her face. His hands were trembling, and although he was talking, it sounded
like gibberish to her. She couldn’t hear anything over the echoes of her
piercing screams ricocheting around in her head, interspersed with static. If
she had the will to speak, she would have asked him for water to rinse out
the taste of blood, semen, and dirt in her mouth. Instead, she let him scrub
her face until he gave up and rounded the truck to climb into the driver’s
seat.
The moment the truck began to move, she deflated, closing her eyes and
slumping against the door. It seemed that she closed her eyes for a minute.
When she opened them, Jesse was tugging her out of the truck, into a pit.
She flailed before her eyes adjusted and she recognized their surroundings.
They were in their garage with the door already down, which is why it was
so dark. Her sluggish heart leapt.
“Dad’s not home,” Jesse murmured as he toted her into the house.
She had a feeling of déjà vu as he placed her in the tub. This time, she
wasn’t shellshocked and heartbroken. She was coherent and functional, but
her emotions had been switched off. She was grateful.
In contrast, Jesse fluttered around her, his unshakeable poise, gone. His
face was drawn and the glassy horror in his blue eyes warmed her because
this time it was he who was rattled. He manically scrubbed her down and
seemed obsessed with cleaning every nook and cranny, even cleaning inside
her ears like she was a child.
When he tried to dress her in a nightgown, she reached for jeans and a
top.
“Violet.”
“I’m going to school.”
He said nothing, just stood there in jeans and nothing else.
“You don’t have to take me,” she said.
He spun on his heel and disappeared into the bathroom. She hummed as
she stared at her array of underwear. What color did she want to wear? She
was still trying to decide when Jesse reappeared, clean and fully dressed.
She frowned.
“It’s been fifteen minutes,” he said.
“Oh.”
He swallowed. “I think you should stay here.”
“No.” She had to go to school where her friends were. Where she felt
safe, even if it was just for a little while. She couldn’t stay at home, in her
bedroom. She would lose it.
Jesse didn’t argue. He selected white underwear and held it out for her
to step into. He pulled them up without copping a feel or doing anything
else lecherous and dressed her in jeans and a gray hoodie.
She led the way back to the garage and climbed into the truck. Jesse
stared at her through the windshield for what seemed to be forever before
he got in. The garage door opened, flooding the space with light.
She had no idea what time it was, but traffic hour had passed. Even
though there was a clock on the dashboard, she couldn’t bring herself to
look at it. Her surroundings seemed sharper, brighter, more vibrant.
“I’m sorry.”
Jesse’s croak made no impact on her.
“I swear, I—”
“Shut up.”
Her voice sounded as empty and hollow as she felt.
“I don’t know what’s happening to me. Something in my head just
snapped.”
“You should seek help,” she advised coolly.
Jesse turned into the school parking lot. There was no one around since
everyone was in class. She reached for her backpack and ignored her filthy
clothes on the floorboard.
“Violet.”
She glanced at him. The monster was gone. In his place was a
tormented teenager. If she didn’t know any better, she would have thought
he was the one who’d been attacked. He was pale, sweating, and looked
devastated. He’d aged five years in a matter of hours.
“Report me,” he ordered.
His words sliced through the blessed numbness and zapped some of her
dead emotions back to life.
Jesse blinked rapidly as his eyes filled with tears. “You should get help.
I’ve gone too far. I’ll accept the consequences, whatever they are.”
He leaned over, gripped her face between both hands, and kissed her. It
was an apology, a goodbye.
He pulled back, whispered, “I love you,” and gave her one last, hungry
kiss before he hopped out of the truck and slammed the door behind him.
He stalked toward school without a backpack, hands in his pockets. She
sat there for several seconds before she slipped out, shouldered her
backpack, and headed in the opposite direction.
As she opened the door of a building, the bell rang. Students flooded the
hallways. Everyone walked around her like she wasn’t even there. No one
called out her name or tried to stop her from reaching her destination. Her
feet felt like they were in blocks of cement. The closer she got to the office,
the more she felt like she couldn’t breathe.
“Honey, can I help you?”
Violet stared at the smiling office clerk behind the desk. The woman had
short, curly hair, and pink hibiscus earrings. The woman looked so cheerful
and warm, like nothing bad had ever happened to her, while Violet felt like
she had been hacked to pieces with a machete and was about to fall apart.
The woman’s smile faded. “Honey, are you okay?”
Violet nodded, even as tears began to slip down her face. The woman
rushed around the counter and rubbed her hands up and down Violet’s arms.
“What’s going on, dear? What’s happened?”
“I…”
Violet gulped back tears. This was it. This was her moment. All she had
to do was tell the nice lady what had happened to her—what had been
happening to her for six months, and it would be over. She had proof—
semen in her mouth, pussy, ass. She was raw, bruised, and had his DNA
under her fingernails. Her scratches would be all over his body, and his
tongue was still swollen from her biting it. This was the right thing to do—
what he’d urged her to do for both their sakes.
But she couldn’t do it.
“I think I have my period and stained my pants,” she wailed.
The woman’s face cleared. “Oh, honey, we’ve all been there. It’s going
to be okay. Come, let me help you.”
Violet was curled up on the front seat of the truck when the
driver’s door opened. Jesse stared at her for a minute before he slid in and
rested his hand on her head. She whimpered like a wounded animal as tears
slipped out of raw, swollen eyes.
Once the sweet lady in the office gave her a tampon and reassured her
that her pants weren’t stained, she trudged back to the truck and collapsed
on the seat. She lay there for hours, trying to gather the strength to go in and
tell her story, but she couldn’t move. She listened to the bells ring, knowing
she was running out of time, and now it was over.
Jesse didn’t tell her to sit up and put on her seatbelt as he started up the
truck. As he drove, his hand sifted through her hair, stroked her cheek, and
rubbed her quivering back while she sobbed.
Once Jesse parked the truck in the garage, he cradled her in his arms.
She was too distraught to care if their parents were home but figured neither
of them were when Jesse slid into bed with her.
He held her as she cried and beat her fists against his chest and
screamed that she hated him. He didn’t say a word. He let her rage and
when it was over, he undressed her and tended to every mark he’d left
behind.
It didn’t surprise her when he eased himself inside of her. He didn’t
move, he just petted and nuzzled her. But she didn’t want to be placated.
She needed a release, an outlet for all the horrible things going on inside of
her that were tearing her apart.
When she shoved him onto his back, he didn’t resist. She rode him,
setting a brutal pace that went on and on because her mind was too fucked
up to let her climax. In the end, Jesse helped push her over the edge. When
she collapsed on top of him, he held her until her breathing had evened out,
and she was still and quiet. He didn’t seek an orgasm for himself, but kissed
her forehead, tucked the blankets around her, and left.
Violet turned on her side, stared at the far wall, and felt absolutely
nothing.

JESSE.
3 WEEKS LATER.
“I can’t take it anymore. What’s going on between you two?”
Jesse stopped in his tracks and turned to face Mom, who stood in the
entrance of the kitchen, hands on hips.
“Vi,” Mom said sharply as Violet tried to escape into the hallway.
Violet halted but kept her back to them.
Mom looked back and forth between them before she demanded, “What
happened?”
Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Dad’s head turn from the TV.
Unease tripped down Jesse’s spine, but he kept his face blank as Mom
continued.
“From the moment you two came home from school until you went to
sleep, you used to spend every moment together. I could hear you talking
and laughing for hours, and now…” Mom swept her hands in the empty
expanse between them. “You barely exchange a word. Isaac mentioned that
disagreement you had a few weeks ago that made Violet so upset that she
wanted to ride the bus?”
Mom shot Jesse a quizzical look, clearly expecting him to explain, but
he remained silent.
“I thought you two worked it out, and we were all just busy—you,
Jesse, with baseball, and Vi spending most of her time with Georgia and
Allison because of that science project. But now, I know something’s
wrong.”
Mom stopped, giving them the opportunity to confirm or deny her
charge. Jesse slipped his hands into his pockets and gave Violet time to
answer for both of them. He’d known this moment would come. It was only
a matter of time before someone confronted Violet about her ghostlike
appearance and the fact that she’d gone mute. Her fire, which had always
been so much a part of her, had been extinguished.
Come on, baby. You can do it, he silently urged. He couldn’t stand the
suspense. Every day he wondered if it was going to be his last of freedom.
Every time a stranger appeared in his classroom doorway or at practice, he
wondered if Violet finally plucked up the courage to do the right thing, only
for each instance to be a false alarm that left him drenched in cold sweat.
The emotional roller coaster was exhausting. He wanted his fate decided.
Waiting for the axe to fall was intolerable.
“Jesse?”
The uncertainty in Mom’s tone sliced through his gut. Mom had always
trusted him implicitly, but he glimpsed her bewilderment and a hint of
apprehension. Had the incident with Tucker made Mom realize that she
didn’t know him as well as she thought, which meant he could be
responsible for Violet’s drastic personality change?
“Violet.”
At Isaac’s stern tone, Violet stirred. She turned, revealing a bloodless
face and eyes so glassy and empty that Jesse looked away.
“Tell me this has nothing to do with Tucker,” Dad ordered.
“This has nothing to do with Tucker,” Violet parroted in a flat
monotone.
Dad relaxed and glanced at Jesse. “You said you’d make it up to her.”
He cleared his dry throat. “I tried.”
Dad switched his gaze back to Violet. “That wasn’t good enough?”
Jesse tensed. “It’s not her fault. It’s mine,” he interjected swiftly.
Isaac’s focus didn’t waver from Violet. “I can’t recall the last time I
heard you two argue, much less fight. What could Jesse have done to make
you hold such a grudge?”
Jesse felt like his heart was being squeezed in a vice. It took every
ounce of self-control he possessed not to fidget as he waited for Violet to
respond, but she said nothing.
“Ephesians 4:26 says not to let the sun go down on your anger. You’ve
let this go on for weeks,” Isaac said quietly. “The devil is always looking
for an opportunity to come into a family and cause discord, to divide and
conquer. There’s nothing Jesse could have done that can’t be forgiven.”
“Dad,” Jesse stressed, but Isaac ignored him and continued his lecture.
“Matthew 6:14 says if you forgive others, God will also forgive you. No
one is perfect. Give Jesse grace, Vi, so one day someone will do the same
for you.” Isaac paused a moment to let that sink in before he continued,
“Jesse’s running to the church to pick up supplies for the work we’re doing
on the McMillan’s house tomorrow. Go with him. Talk. Bury this once and
for all. If you can’t resolve your issues, Mom and I will get involved, and
we shouldn’t have to. You two are adults now. Act like it.” Isaac jerked his
chin. “Go change, Vi. Jesse’s leaving in five minutes.”
When Violet didn’t move to obey Isaac’s order, the tension in the room
thickened. Jesse sensed Violet wrestling with herself. His heart thudded in
his ears as he waited for her to break her silence and condemn him. Isaac
scooted to the edge of his seat, clearly ready to deal with this on his feet,
but before he could, Violet abruptly turned on her heel and disappeared
down the hallway.
As Mom watched her go with a concerned expression, Isaac’s hard gaze
cut to Jesse.
“You’re always trying to protect her.” Isaac held up a hand to stop his
protest. “I know my daughter better than anyone. She’s strong-willed,
impulsive, and has a nose for trouble. Ever since Tucker, she’s changed, and
not for the better. She needs accountability. What’s going to happen when
you’re not around to save her?”
He opened his mouth to crush Isaac’s illusions about him and instead
heard himself say, “I love her.”
“I know you do.” Isaac sighed as he leaned back in his recliner. “You’d
do anything for her. She knows it and takes advantage.”
Isaac was an honorable, hard-working, practical man, but when it came
to matters of the heart, he was blind. Because he embodied everything Isaac
had always wanted in a son, Isaac couldn’t see his faults. On the flip side,
when it came to Violet, Isaac discounted her good qualities and instead
focused on the bad ones that reminded him of his first love that he’d never
forgiven. How many times over the years had he defended Violet against a
father, who was too hard on her and had never given her the grace he
expected of her?
What would Isaac say if he confessed what he’d done? Isaac assumed
because he loved Violet that he was incapable of truly harming her. He
believed the same until she scorned his love and destroyed his illusions of a
future together. He could set the record straight and clear her name. He
steeled himself, but before he could speak, Violet reappeared.
She was dressed in black pants, a t-shirt, a light jacket, and a hat pulled
low over her eyes. She didn’t say a word as she crossed the living room to
where he stood by the front door. He opened it for her. As Violet trotted
down the steps, he looked back. Isaac had gone back to watching TV, but
Mom’s eyes were on him.
His mother was a glass half full, eternal optimist who believed that good
would always prevail. She had a kind heart. He’d always thought of his
mother as being somewhat naive, but as their eyes met, he realized the rosecolored glasses were missing and she looked… disturbed. Unlike Isaac,
Mom wasn’t blind. She may love him more than life itself, but she also
loved Violet with the same ferocity and, unlike Isaac, she would believe
Violet in a heartbeat. He flashed her what he hoped was a reassuring smile
before he turned away, his stomach in knots.
It wasn’t until he unlocked the truck that it struck him. He stared
through the window at Violet, who stood on the opposite side. They hadn’t
ridden in this vehicle since that day. They couldn’t switch to the SUV
because he needed the truck bed for the paint cans and lumber he had to
pick up. He blew out a breath before he pulled the door open.
Automatically, his eyes scanned the interior, even though he’d thoroughly
cleaned it. He turned the key in the ignition and waited.
It took Violet several minutes to open the door, and a few more before
she actually got in. As she settled beside him, he sensed her reluctance,
resentment, and the smallest trace of fear. He didn’t blame her. He hadn’t
known he was capable of what he’d done in that field.
They rode in absolute silence. Despite Dad’s decree that they sort this
out, Violet didn’t try. Both of them knew nothing could fix this.
He slumped in his seat and tilted his head back while keeping his eyes
on the road. Violet was right beside him, but her presence was so faint, it
was almost like she wasn’t there at all. She’d become a wraith, drifting
through life, lost in her head. Even though she loathed him, the urge to
reach out and touch her, to bridge the distance between them, was a
gnawing, dragging compulsion that made him tighten his hold on the
steering wheel.
He hadn’t touched her since the day they visited the bluebonnet field.
Not even a stray brush of his fingers while passing her a plate at dinner. He
knew if he did, he wouldn’t be able to stop himself from taking more, and
he’d taken enough.
You think if it felt so good, if we were meant to be, that I would spend an
hour scrubbing my body every time you touch me and still never feel clean?
The memory of her voice, filled with venom and revulsion, tore through
him like shrapnel, reopening wounds that hadn’t even begun to heal. He
wholeheartedly believed Violet loved him and, at some point, would
surrender to what was between them. It never occurred to him that their
bond could fracture beyond repair or that, one day, she would look through
him as if he wasn’t there.
How had he misjudged her feelings for him so badly? Had he imagined
her eyes following him months before she gave herself to him? Had he
convinced himself she desired him when she didn’t? He straightened and
raked his hand through his hair as he shifted restlessly in his seat. No. It
hadn’t been all in his head. She kissed him, which tipped their relationship
into the physical realm. And before the reality of their circumstances tainted
what they had, Violet had given herself freely, eager to experience any and
everything he could offer her. The memories of her initiation and the
handful of days where they experimented to their heart’s content reassured
him that it wasn’t all in his mind, even as it tormented him with what was
forever out of his reach.
When their bodies writhed together and the crap from the outside world
faded away, what bloomed between them was so special, he vowed he
would do whatever it took to keep it. So, he’d ignored her struggles,
denials, and breakdowns. Ignored her babbling about all the reasons why
they couldn’t be together. He tried to give her time and space to come to
terms with what was between them, but the more he had of her, the more his
appetite increased. The fact that her body wept for him, and she clung so
tight in the throes, yet repeatedly rejected him, drove him insane. He
assumed the constant imprinting on her body would overcome her
reservations. He’d believed that in the end, love would conquer all.
How wrong he’d been.
“I feel nothing for you at all.”
Black spots marred his vision as rage engulfed him. He squinted at the
road as he tried to think past the bloodlust. He lost his mind when she said
that. When he realized she would never love him back. He built his life
around her, and she wanted nothing to do with him.
She called him a monster, and he proved her right by giving his demon
free rein. He punished her for not loving him back, for annihilating his
dreams, and ruining the man he could have been. He mauled her like an
animal, and she fought back with an aggression that, even now, made his
dick hard. They had been stripped of all civilization, which resulted in a
transcendent experience that unequivocally proved she was his equal. That
field of wildflowers would always be his version of Eden and Violet,
whether she wanted to be or not, was his wicked, savage temptress, Eve.
He glanced at her. She stared straight ahead, one hand loosely clutching
the seatbelt resting on her chest. If she truly hated him, why hadn’t she
reported him? She’d been given many opportunities to expose him, but she
hadn’t. She claimed she didn’t want to break Mom’s heart, but Mom had
nothing to do with how she let him tend to her when they came home that
day or how she took what she needed from his body.
He took a deep breath and let it out slowly, ignoring the surge of
adrenaline and the way his muscles flexed as his mind replayed her riding
him. The only time Violet gave into their chemistry is when he roused her
to a fever pitch, or she was too emotionally shattered to care about her
scruples. Only then did she allow herself to indulge in their bond and allow
it to soothe her.
The day after their violent clash, he visited the recruiter’s office to
complete the enlistment process to join the Air Force. He’d put off making a
final decision in hopes that Violet would come to her senses, but he was
running out of time. Mom and Dad assumed he was going to a local
college. He stopped talking about the military because it had upset Mom so
much, but he hadn’t changed his mind. Joining the Air Force was a promise
he made to his father that he always intended to keep. He had never second
guessed his decision until Violet. If he went into the military, his life
wouldn’t be his own. He drove to that secluded location, intending to lay
himself at her feet and have her decide his future, only to be told in no
uncertain terms that she wanted nothing to do with him.
Any man who had been as brutally rejected as he had, should have been
instantly cured of his infatuation. To have the life of his life encourage him
to have sex with other females and to label their relationship as poisonous
and rotten should have made moving on a piece of cake. He ran a hand
down his face, disgusted with himself. If he believed in witchcraft, he may
have believed she cast a spell on him because he still yearned for her. She
was a part of him, imbedded bone deep. There was no getting her out. He’d
tried. There were countless girls who would have him, but the one he’d kill
for hated his guts. He still loved her and a part of him suspected that he
always would. His life was a cruel joke.
He pulled into the empty church parking lot and reversed the truck to
make it easier to load the supplies. He sorted through the keys Pastor Sonny
had given him as he approached the chapel and lifted his head when he
heard a door slam. He paused as Violet rounded the truck and passed him to
jog up the steps. He couldn’t resist staring at her ass and had a vivid image
of her on all fours with the red outline of his hand on her right cheek along
with a bite mark that had long since faded.
Need slammed into him with the force of a baseball bat. He’d taken
great pains to steer clear of her. He’d been grateful that she caught rides
with friends to and from school and had spent as much time as she could at
their homes. It helped him wean himself off of her, to exercise self-control,
but he was starkly aware that they were alone with no one around for miles
on a late, quiet Friday afternoon.
His demon salivated and flashed erotic images in his mind, snapshots of
their last, devastating encounter. Depraved desires snaked through his mind,
edging out the pain of her rejection. He hesitated at the bottom of the steps.
The reformed part of him wanted to order her to stay in the truck or, better
yet, call their parents to pick her up. She wasn’t safe with him.
But he didn’t say a word. Instead, he made his way toward her, fingers
tingling, heart racing. He knew what he was going to do. Maybe a part of
him had known the moment she got in the truck with him. It was always
going to end this way. If he was presented with the opportunity to have her,
he didn’t have the will to resist. Even if it jeopardized his freedom. Even if
it wrecked their family. Nothing compared to the absolute bliss of
possessing her. He would pay any price to have her. To be buried inside of
her where he belonged.
It didn’t matter if they ran the risk of being caught. He would take her
anytime, anywhere. He didn’t give a fuck if it was in God’s house. If sex
was all he could have of her, he would take as much as he could until she
reported him, or someone put a bullet in his head. He was an addicted
maniac. There was something terribly wrong with him for wanting someone
who despised him. But he didn’t care. He’d take her hatred and disdain.
He’d take her fighting. He’d take whatever she gave him as long as he got
her.
He kept his eyes downcast, maintaining the role of chastened
stepbrother. If Violet looked into his eyes, she’d know what was coming.
There was a fine tremor in the hand that inserted the key in the lock and
turned it. He pushed open the door and Violet stepped through. He watched
her walk down the aisle between the pews. Cast in the light that came
through the massive stained-glass windows, she looked ethereal,
untouchable. No matter how many times he claimed her, she remained
maddeningly out of reach.
Hands on hips, Violet surveyed the empty stage. What was she
thinking? He gave the church a cursory glance. This is where their parents
married and where they’d come nearly every Sunday for four years. He
spent countless hours here praying, worshipping, volunteering. He spent a
significant portion of his summer renovating this church… For what? To
have God laugh in his face and take from him the only thing he’d ever
wanted?
Fury heated his blood. He’d been a good son, taking care of his mother
when his father died. He studied diligently for good grades, worked hard to
attain his skills as an athlete and earned his money through manual labor.
He didn’t cheat or steal. He had one dream. One weakness. One thing he
desired above all else. He thought God placed Violet in his life because she
was meant to be his, only for God to be one of the reasons Violet was
convinced they couldn’t be together.
Violet had quoted every scripture about how God judged the sexually
immoral, and how sex outside of marriage went against God’s design. He
would have let Mom and Dad catch them in the act if he thought they’d
force her to marry him. But he suspected their parent’s remedy would be to
bury their indiscretion instead of trying to rectify it. They would be relieved
to ship him off to the military and ensure they had no future contact with
each other, which left him with no leverage to bind Violet to him.
God and Violet had been major pillars in his life. They guided and
shaped him. He gave them his all only to walk away empty-handed and
heartbroken, with his best friend and soul mate lost to him for all time. God
had played him for a fool, tormenting him with false visions and hopes that
would never come true. Didn’t God know what happened to faithful men
who weren’t rewarded? They stopped praying and took matters into their
own hands. If being the good guy didn’t get him what he wanted, what was
the point of restraining himself?
He drew in a deep breath, taking in Violet’s powdery scent mixing with
the smell of old Bibles, furniture polish, and wood pews. He didn’t have it
in him to be gentle, loving, or patient any longer. He was desperate,
deprived, and starving. With graduation just two months away and his ship
date for the military pending, he had mere weeks left with her. He wasn’t
going to abstain. He was going to gorge, knowing, no matter how much he
indulged, it would never be enough.
As if Violet caught the tail end of his thought, her head whipped around.
The moment their eyes collided, hers flared in instant recognition.
“You promised.”
Her voice was nearly soundless even in the hushed, quiet sanctuary.
“I’ve done my best.” His voice was gruff with lust. “I’ve never been
able to keep my promises where you’re concerned. I can’t be around you
and not…” He swallowed hard and extended his hand, palm out. “It won’t
be like last time. I can be gentle.”
When she recoiled, his hand balled into a fist and dropped to his side.
“Don’t run,” he ordered, knowing it would trigger primitive instincts
that he was trying to stifle. She deserved gentle. She deserved sweet. If she
came to him, if she allowed him to touch without fighting, he could control
his rampaging demon, but if she… His control vanished as Violet bolted
down the aisle.
If the back door had been unlocked, Violet would have escaped. Instead,
she wasted precious seconds fumbling with the lock and had to dash away
before he could get his hands on her.
She leapt up the stairs, intending to cross the stage, to reach a door on
the other side of the sanctuary, but she didn’t make it. He flattened her on
the steps.
“You can’t do this here!” she hissed fiercely.
He was pleased her warrior spirit was back. That meant he didn’t have
to rein himself in. He could indulge his demon’s appetite and give them an
experience that would be etched into their memories for all time.
“Why not here? God already knows what we’ve done,” he said as he
flipped her onto her back and unceremoniously yanked her pants down.
She engaged in a furious tug of war with him while simultaneously
trying to keep an eye on multiple entrances. When he yanked hard enough
to pull her down a step, she tried to kick him in the head, which allowed
him to free one leg from her pants. That was all he needed. He ripped her
maroon lace underwear off, forced her legs wide, and clamped his mouth on
her pussy. Her breath whooshed out of her and her body went taut as a bow.
It had been weeks since he tasted her. Weeks since he’d been inside her.
The moment his tongue sank inside her, he knew he was lost. He’d gone
back to taking her underwear to get him off, but that paled in comparison to
this. To drinking from her. To feeling her thigh muscles quiver as she
strained to get away. To the honey that spilled from her against her will.
Those tormented, helpless sounds she made were music to his ears. His
awareness of their surroundings vanished. He didn’t care where they were
or who tried to interrupt them. He wasn’t stopping unless someone
physically hauled him off her.
He slid his finger inside her to coax her to spill a little more for him.
“Please, stop,” she begged as she hauled her quivering body up a step.
He followed, keeping his mouth on her while he felt around for her Gspot. He knew he found it when she let out a wanton moan that echoed
around the sanctuary before she muffled it with her arm.
He lifted his head, eager for proof that she still needed this from him.
She let out a stifled sob as he pushed her arm aside. She glared at him, eyes
shining with self-loathing, lust, and hatred. She’d never looked more
beautiful to him.
“You,” she began gutturally, but her voice cut out when he cupped her.
Her thighs snapped together, trapping his hand, which he didn’t mind in
the least. As his fingers expertly stroked, her legs tossed back and forth.
“You’ve been missing me, Vi. Admit it,” he rasped.
“You’re a heartless…” She bared her teeth as she pulled herself up
another step. “Evil.”
She collapsed on the stage and turned on her side in the fetal position.
Mouth watering at the feast before him, he took his hand from her to undo
his jeans. Violet shot up and tried to make a break for it, but he was on her
in a flash. She didn’t gain more than three steps before he wrapped his arms
around her and got her down on all fours. He put her in a chokehold as he
blanketed her body with his.
“Nuh-uh, baby. You’re not getting away. I’ve gone too long without
you.”
“Please don’t do this,” she pleaded.
“You want this so bad, you’re soaking my jeans,” he hissed as he rocked
against her.
“We’re in church!”
She sounded scandalized.
He pressed his cheek to hers as they stared at the rows of empty pews.
“It doesn’t matter where we are. I’ll always want you.”
He gripped her throat with one hand while the other undid his jeans and
shoved them down.
“You know you want this,” he panted as he dragged his dick up and
down her weeping slit. “Your body still craves me. Still wants me to fuck
you senseless.” He nuzzled her as she let out a choked sob. “That’s exactly
what you want me to do, isn’t it? Tell me that’s what you want, Violet.”
“You have no shame,” she croaked.
“You have enough for the both of us,” he mocked as he lapped up a
stray tear. “How we feel about each other is nothing to be ashamed of. It’s
supposed to be something we rejoice in.”
“The devil will say anything to make a sin seem like a gift,” she said
bitterly.
So now he was the devil on top of being a monster. All because he loved
her and wasn’t willing to lie about his feelings or hide how she made him
feel.
“If the way of the righteous means I can’t have this…”
He gently thrust. It was so quiet, they both heard the sloppy sounds her
body made. She whimpered in shame and tried to hang her head, but he
wouldn’t let her, forcing her to face their invisible jury.
“Then I’ll be a sinner,” he said through clenched teeth and tried to hold
back his beast, which wanted to slake his lust savagely, ensuring her
submission and repentance. “I wish everyone could see you, dripping all
over the stage, taking every inch of me. Loving every fucking moment of
this. Whenever you come through those doors, and look at this stage, you’re
going to think of this, of us.”
“No!”
She made a desperate lunge for the edge of the stage, but he held her in
place. She wasn’t going anywhere.
“Pray for divine intervention,” he taunted as her vagina clutched at his
invading cock. “If this is wrong, God will save you. He wouldn’t let His
faithful daughter be defiled in His own house, would he?”
She reached back and gripped his thigh, fingernails raking his skin.
“Stop! You can’t…”
He was so fucking tired of hearing her say that. He cut her off as he
abruptly slammed himself inside of her, making her release a shrill scream
that echoed around the chapel.
“I can’t what?” he whispered, fingers tightening around her throat as his
demon howled in triumph. “I can’t fuck you in a church? I can’t make you
want me?”
“I hate you!”
Her words skewered his heart. Despair and lust tangled in a devastating
mix that decimated his control and his desire to be gentle. He abruptly
straightened and gripped her hips.
“You better hope someone walks through that door and saves you,” he
growled as he began to move in hard, brutal strokes that caused her whole
body to jolt. “And puts us both out of our misery.”
He took what he wanted, what he needed, or he’d go insane. He didn’t
hold back, couldn’t. Not after being so long without her. He dared God to
take her from him, to deny him this after everything he’d sacrificed. He
made Violet beg, cry, scream, and moan. He was certain this form of
worship had never been practiced here, but he ensured if God was
watching, it was memorable.
He wasn’t ready to come, but when she rippled around him, he almost
went over the edge with her. He ground his teeth, fighting his response as
she impaled herself on him, taking what she needed and shuddering in relief
as he met her needs.
Unable to withstand another second, he flipped her on her back. He
straddled her chest, knees pinning her arms on either side of her even
though she was no longer fighting, but he wasn’t taking any chances. He
gripped her cheeks and forced her mouth open. His jubilant shout echoed
through the church as he spilled, as he defiled a place he’d once considered
sacred, and accepted the fact that he was going to hell.
Violet stared up at him with glazed eyes. Needing to prolong the
moment, he slid his dick in her mouth and released her cheeks. He was
tense, waiting for her to bite, but he relaxed and stroked her hair when she
sucked and let her tongue feather over the sensitive head.
“Good girl,” he husked.
That broke the spell. She went rigid beneath him and tipped her head to
the side to expel his dick. She coughed and retched, but she’d already
swallowed most of him, which is all he cared about. She began to buck and
kick beneath him. He admired her for a few seconds before he rolled off her
and collapsed behind Pastor Sonny’s wood podium.
Violet stumbled to her feet and wove drunkenly toward her clothes
strewn on the steps, swiping at her face as she hastily dressed. He listened
to her run out of the church and the loud bang as the heavy door slammed
shut behind her.
He waited to be clobbered by those incipient emotions that had dogged
him since he jacked off at church camp—shame, guilt, regret, remorse, fear,
disgust. All he felt was warm satisfaction. Anyone could have come in and
discovered them, but God hadn’t intervened. Maybe God hadn’t abandoned
him after all.
His climax left him drowsy, but he had work to do. He forced himself to
his feet and dragged his jeans up and fastened them. He made his way to a
closet with cleaning supplies and grabbed a spray bottle and washcloth. He
wiped up all signs of debauchery before he began to execute the task Pastor
Sonny had entrusted to him.
When he made his way out to the truck with four paint cans, he saw
Violet huddled in the front seat. She hadn’t been able to take off since he
had the keys in his pocket and there was no one in the vicinity that she
could ask for a ride. He propped the front door open as he loaded up lumber
and the other building material they hadn’t used during the renovation.
Tomorrow, they would be working on the McMillan’s house, members of
the church who had a house in dire need of repair.
It took thirty minutes to load everything. By the time he joined Violet in
the truck, the sun was beginning to set. He wasn’t surprised when Violet
angled her body away from him. If she had allowed it, he would have
drawn her against his chest and held her. He wanted to tell her he loved her,
that it didn’t have to be this way, but he knew she wouldn’t listen.
He knew she was hating herself, hating him. That was her default
whenever they came together. It didn’t matter how pleasurable and
gratifying. She would always turn it into something amoral and twisted. She
couldn’t admit that a part of her reveled in what they’d done.
As they made their way home, he wondered what Violet would say to
their parents. Had fucking in church pushed her over the edge? Was that the
final straw? He felt a burble of unease, but it couldn’t morph into true fear
because of the overwhelming contentment that canceled out all else. His
mind was empty, his inner turmoil gone. Possessing her in any capacity
made him feel right, centered, whole. He refused to believe she didn’t feel
the same. It wasn’t possible for such a connection to be one-sided. Their
chemistry had been ordained by God. If she had loved him a fraction of
how much he loved her, they could have conquered anything. Instead, she
doomed them to lives where neither would ever be truly fulfilled.
When he pulled into the driveway, he glanced at Violet and waited to
see if she had any last words for him before she decided his fate. She kept
her face averted as she pushed open the door and hopped out. He ambled in
her wake, hands in pockets.
As he expected, their parents hung around. Mom was still in the kitchen
and Dad was in the living room. Both turned when they walked through the
front door. Violet stopped in her tracks, clearly not anticipating this. He
waited several seconds before he moved her inside so he could close the
door.
“So?” Isaac prompted.
Mom came out of the kitchen, wiping her hands on a dish towel, her
face still pinched with worry.
Violet was so rigid, she was trembling. He glanced down at her and saw
her mouth open and eyes fill with tears.
“Violet?” Mom asked.
He curbed his arm around Violet’s shoulders and turned her into him a
second before she burst into tears. His hand sank into her hair and kept her
face pressed to his chest as he said, “She forgave me, but she’s still hurt and
angry.”
Violet’s hand fisted in his shirt.
Mom’s expression eased slightly. “Forgiveness doesn’t take away the
hurt, but it’ll pass.” Mom came up to them and rubbed Violet’s back. “Are
you okay, honey? Want to talk about it?”
His hand dropped to Violet’s nape and squeezed. A second later, Violet
shook her head.
“Violet helped me load up the truck. We’re a little dirty,” he said.
Mom nodded and stepped back. “Dinner will be ready in a half hour.”
He glanced at Isaac and got a curt, approving nod. Isaac was satisfied
with his explanation and wouldn’t push Violet any further, for which he was
grateful. He used his body to shield Violet from their scrutiny and ushered
her down the hallway. He entered his bedroom since it was closer and
directed her into the bathroom. Intending to get her in the shower, he started
to lift her shirt without registering the fire in her eyes until it was too late.
Her slap snapped his head to the side.
“You got what you wanted from me,” she seethed. “Now, get out.”
He ignored his throbbing face and reached for her. “It’s not like that. I
wanted...”
She wrenched away, grabbed her hairbrush, and held it like a knife. “I
know what you wanted! It’s the only thing you care about!”
“Vi.”
“I swear to God,” she choked. “If you touch me one more time, I’m
going to lose it.”
He held up his hands. “Okay, I’m going.”
He backed into his bedroom. She closed the bathroom door and a
second later, locked it. He stood there, face smarting, and heard the shower
switch on to drown out the sound of her sobbing.
He leaned back against the door and closed his eyes. Those feelings he
thought he bested came back with a vengeance, clobbering him over the
head, drowning him in self-loathing. His chest swelled with the need to
roar, but he swallowed it and staggered to his bed.
Even though he regretted the pain he caused, he knew that wouldn’t
stop him from partaking in the future. If he had a shred of decency, he
would put Violet out of her misery and turn himself in, but he wasn’t the
self-sacrificing hero. Thanks to her, he’d finally embraced what he was. He
wasn’t the knight in shining armor. He was the villain. What self-respecting
monster willingly walked into a cage? If Violet wanted him out of her life,
she had to declare what he was to the world. Until then, he was going to
take his fill.
At some point, she would find the strength to turn him in. He wasn’t
sure if that would be this evening over dinner or a month from now, but she
would. If he wanted a chance at a future that wasn’t behind bars, he had to
get the hell away from her. Having the military dictate his life was the best
thing for him since he had no control where she was concerned. It was best
that he leave before they destroyed one another.

VIOLET.
1 MONTH LATER.
“How was work, honey?” Mom asked as she set a pile of steaming
bread rolls in the middle of the table.
“Funny you should ask,” Dad drawled with a lopsided grin as he
reached for one and broke it in half. “It was an eventful day.”
Mom held up a hand. “You didn’t deal with any dead bodies, did you?”
“Not today,” Dad said as he bit into his roll.
Mom relaxed. “Okay. So, what happened?”
“The first call we got was from a woman who got her toe stuck in a
faucet.”
Violet came out of her reverie and frowned at her father. “What kind of
faucet?”
“A tub faucet.”
Violet’s brows bunched together. “Why would she do that?”
“I stopped asking questions like that my first year on the job,” Dad said
as he forked up chicken and green beans.
“You didn’t have to amputate anything, did you?” Mom asked.
“Ew, Mom!” Violet waved her hand to dissipate the images in her mind.
“No amputation necessary. Just some lubricant.” Dad snickered. “She
seemed thrilled to have an audience and carried on drinking her wine and
eating chocolates long after the bubbles were gone.” Dad bobbed his
eyebrows at Mom, who gasped and smacked his arm. “I covered her in a
bath towel, which she kept trying to take off while asking if any of us were
single. She was entertaining, to say the least.”
“Was she?” Mom said testily.
Violet’s lips quirked. Automatically, her gaze flicked to Jesse to see his
reaction to their parents’ playful bickering. Her amusement faded. Jesse
stared pensively down at his food, oblivious to their conversation. She
noticed he’d been preoccupied lately. She could hear him pacing in his
room in the wee hours of the morning. He’d also been coming home late
from school, even when he didn’t have practice.
Whatever was bothering him hadn’t affected his sex drive, however. He
was more ravenous than ever. Ever since they had sex at church, it was like
he wanted to get caught. He was becoming alarmingly brazen. She didn’t
know who he was anymore. When he looked at her, she didn’t see her
brother at all, but a stranger.
At lunch today, Brody nudged her and jerked his chin across the
cafeteria, where Jesse sat with an odd mix of people.
“What’s going on there?” Brody asked.
“No idea,” she’d said, but her gaze was on the stunning redhead who
had her hand on Jesse’s arm.
Georgia had pressed against her back to whisper excitedly, “Ooh. Are
they dating?”
She’d turned away with a shrug while Brody said, “Jesse and Faye? He
hasn’t said anything about her, but it sure looks like she’s willing.”
While the guys joked around, Georgia said, “They make a striking
couple. Jesse hasn’t dated anyone this year, has he? What’s the deal?”
When Violet bit into her sandwich to avoid answering, Georgia poked
her in her side.
“You’re his sister. You should be able to give us the inside scoop. I can’t
believe he doesn’t tell you anything. You guys are always together.”
“Jesse’s a gentleman,” Marie interjected. “He doesn’t kiss and tell. He’s
the only guy I know who’s stayed friends with all his exes. None of them
has a bad thing to say about him, except for the fact that he broke up with
them. He gave them princess treatment for a few weeks—opening their
door, pulling out their chairs, buying them flowers, and then bam.” Marie
clapped her hands. “He says they’re done. No warning, no explanation
other than it wasn’t working out. None of them can make sense of it.
They’d take him back in a heartbeat if he asked.”
“I think Madyson took it the hardest. I heard Trent broke up with her
because Jesse’s all she talked about.” Georgia looked around before she
added, “It’s been, like, a year. You’d think she’d be over him by now.”
“Can you really blame her? Jesse’s everything any girl could want in a
boyfriend.”
Violet tuned out her friends and fantasized about her senior year when
she wouldn’t have to listen to her friends gush about what a gentleman
Jesse was. If they only knew what he’d done to her on the way to school
that morning…
Jesse’s gaze abruptly rose and speared hers. Her stomach clenched. She
switched her attention back to Dad and forced herself to eat, even though
she wasn’t hungry. She hoped Jesse dated Faye and transferred all his kinky,
erotic fantasies to the gorgeous redhead instead of her. He was a sex fanatic.
Perverted, twisted. He never missed an opportunity to have his way with
her. The only time she was free of his advances was when she turned in for
the night and locked the bedroom and bathroom door. The next day, the
battle to avoid him began anew.
Jesse was still staring at her. She resolutely ignored him and focused on
Dad, who laughed as he told a story about his coworker who had to defend
himself against a guy wielding an umbrella like a sword while high on some
psychedelic drug.
“And then, Derrick leaps at him and says…” Dad chortled.
“I joined the Air Force.”
Jesse’s statement was said so casually that Violet ignored it. It wasn’t
until silence fell, and she registered that Mom and Dad were both gawking
at Jesse, that she processed what he said.
Shock made her fingers fumble her fork, which clattered loudly as it
dropped on her plate. She assumed Jesse would go to college, but if he went
into the military, that would be even better! Her lips curved in what felt like
the first genuine smile she’d had all year.
“You did what?”
Lynne’s hoarse voice snapped Violet out of her giddy delight.
Registering the tension in the air, she bowed her head to hide her joy, but at
Jesse’s silence, she glanced at him and found him watching her through
narrowed eyes.
“Jesse?”
Lynne’s tone was part plea, part demand. Slowly, Jesse transferred his
attention to his mother who sat across the table from him.
“I enlisted,” Jesse said calmly.
“H-how? You didn’t ask for my consent. I didn’t sign anything allowing
you to—”
“I’m eighteen, Mom.”
Lynne’s expression went from horror to outrage as she shouted, “You
haven’t talked about the military for years!”
Jesse didn’t bat an eye at his mother’s outburst. “Because it upset you,
not because I changed my mind.”
“You saw what losing your father did to me, and you’re volunteering to
put yourself in the same position?”
“I made a promise,” Jesse said quietly.
Lynne slammed her fist on the table. “Do you think your father would
ask you to honor that promise if he knew he would die at thirty?”
“He died with honor.”
“He died instead of having a life with us. He died instead of getting out
when I begged him to.” Lynne’s eyes glistened with tears. “Have you sworn
in?” When Jesse hesitated, Lynne shot to her feet. “I forbid it, Jesse. Quit
now before it’s too late.”
“Mom.”
“I’m serious. I can’t go through that again.” Lynne ran her hands
through her hair. “I can’t believe you’d even consider…”
Violet jolted when Lynne abruptly turned on her.
“You didn’t try to talk him out of it?”
Taken aback, Violet opened and closed her mouth, unsure what to say.
She knew Lynne had a temper, but she had never been on the receiving end
of it until now. Her glee vanished in the face of Lynne’s wild despair.
“Violet didn’t know. I did this on my own,” Jesse interjected.
“Lynne,” Dad said in a consoling tone. “Let’s talk about this.”
“Talk?” Lynne scoffed as she paced with her arms wrapped around
herself. “Apparently, talking isn’t something we do in this house anymore.
People just make major life decisions without telling anyone.”
“Mom, this is my dream.”
Lynne planted her hands on the table and leaned toward her son. “You
idolize your father, but his choices don’t have to be yours. You don’t have
to walk the same path as him. There are better paths. You could be
somebody, Jesse. You’re talented in so many areas. Why let them decide
what to do with your life? Why submit yourself to that harsh environment?
You should enjoy your freedom.” A tear slid down her cheek. “Why do you
want to leave us?”
Jesse swallowed, displaying his first sign of discomfort.
“I don’t want to leave you.”
“So, don’t! Don’t go!”
Jesse lowered his gaze to his plate. “I have to do this.”
“Why?” Lynne cried.
Violet’s heart thudded in her ears as silence fell. Jesse was usually so
careful and considerate of his mother. It was painful to see them at odds.
Lynne looked distraught, but Jesse was standing his ground. Even though
she’d initially been ecstatic at the news, Lynne’s devastation was contagious
and made her own eyes water.
A crack of thunder made her flinch as the heavens opened and rain
began to lash the windows.
“Vi,” Dad said quietly.
She was relieved to be excused from the table and the highly charged
environment. No one said a word as she left her half-eaten dinner and made
her way to her bedroom. She closed the door and winced when she heard
Lynne explode. Her shouting was accompanied by another deafening boom
of thunder that shook the house. She put on her headphones and let her
punk rock music drown out the unexpected storms that had appeared out of
nowhere.
Conflicting emotions sloshed around inside of her. On one hand, she
was thrilled. If Jesse went into the Air Force, she’d be free. As Mom said,
they would decide Jesse’s life. He wouldn’t be able to come home whenever
he felt like it, like he would if he attended college and had holidays and
school breaks. Once he signed, he had to fulfill his commitment, which was
a minimum of four years for Active Duty.
It never crossed her mind that Jesse would join the military. Like Lynne,
she used to get upset when he brought it up. That was when she actually
cared about what he did with his life. Now, she wanted him gone. Out of
her life, out of the state, out of the country, if possible. She bit her lip. She
despised him, but she didn’t want him dead. Lynne was acting like Jesse
would be sent to the front lines. Surely, Mom was overreacting?
Is this what he wanted to talk about when he drove her out to see the
bluebonnets? She assumed he wanted to talk about which college he should
attend. He hadn’t talked about the military in years. If Jesse had given her a
choice of him going to college or the military, what would she have said?
She tossed her hair, not willing to entertain such thoughts. Jesse’s future
wasn’t her business. It was his, and he made the decision to enlist, which
she was happy about—ecstatic, in fact.
Her life had become an endless tunnel with no light, no detours, no one
to hold her hand. Jesse would jump her in the dark and corner and coerce
her to get what he wanted before he disappeared, leaving her to piece
herself back together and carry on, hand outstretched, as she tried to find
her way in the pitch-black abyss. Sometimes, when she was too broken to
walk, she crawled. She kept going, believing there had to be something up
ahead. Jesse’s announcement caused a pinprick of light to cut through the
dark, giving her a vision of a near future where there would be no tunnel, no
filth, no more structuring her life around ways to avoid him. There was an
end to her misery and despite Lynne’s fear, all Violet felt was overwhelming
relief.
She tried to distract herself with homework, but her attention strayed.
She tugged aside the headphones periodically to check if the coast was
clear. The arguing went on for hours. Most of the time, it was Lynne who
was shouting, but there was also the low murmur of Dad’s voice in what
sounded like a conciliatory tone.
She’d decided to turn in for the night and had just brushed her teeth and
locked the bathroom door behind her when her bedroom door opened.
When Mom poked her head in, Violet tugged off her headphones and held
them in one hand as she took in Lynne’s red, puffy eyes. Her anxiety spiked
as she waited for the verdict. Had Mom talked Jesse out of joining the Air
Force?
“Mom?”
When Lynne’s face crumpled, she rushed forward, partly because it
looked like Lynne was going to collapse and partly because she didn’t want
Lynne to see her jubilation. Comforting Lynne while she inwardly did
cartwheels made her feel like a bad person, but she couldn’t help it. No one
knew who Jesse truly was. This was best for all of them, Lynne just didn’t
know it. As Lynne wept, that tiny bead of light in her tunnel began to
expand and brighten, so she could practically feel its warmth.
Lynne pulled back and braced her hands on her shoulders. “Please talk
to him. He hasn’t sworn in. There’s still a chance for him to get out of his
commitment.”
Alarm cut through Violet’s contentment. “I… I don’t think anything I
say will make a difference. His mind is made up and…” She looked away
from Lynne’s heartbroken eyes. “He didn’t tell me what he was going to do.
It seems like he didn’t want anyone to dissuade him.”
Lynne squeezed her arms. “You’re his best friend. You two are closer
than blood siblings. If you tell him you want him to stay, that you need him
here, he might do it for you.”
Her throat began to close as anxiety ripped through her. “We’ve grown
apart.”
“You still mean the world to him. You can save him from making a huge
mistake.”
“I…”
“Just try. Please.”
An invisible object obstructed her throat so she couldn’t breathe,
making her eyes tear. Lynne cupped her cheek, expression softening,
assuming they were on the same wavelength when nothing could be further
from the truth.
Lynne kissed her cheek. “Sleep. Hopefully, we’ll wake up and this will
all just be a horrible dream.”
After Mom left, she waited a few minutes to see if Dad was going to
pop in. When he didn’t, she locked that door, too, and climbed into bed. She
stared at the ceiling as she listened to the rain hammer down on the roof. A
tree branch Dad had been meaning to cut scraped the side of the house as
the wind picked up.
Is that what Jesse had been doing after school? Getting his paperwork
and tests done to qualify and enlist? Even though Jesse hadn’t sworn in
(whatever that meant), hopefully he was too far along in the process to back
out without consequences. She would do almost anything for Lynne, but
begging Jesse to stay wasn’t one of them. She pounded her pillow as she
turned on her side. Jesse would be fine in the military. There was no need
for Lynne to worry about him. This was a dream come true.
She woke when a hand clamped over her mouth. Her eyes flew open
as a man sat on top of her. She panicked and thrashed as his weight sank her
into the mattress. She let out a scream that was significantly muffled by his
hand and the storm, which was still raging.
A head ducked down, and a nose brushed against hers before she heard,
“Happy I’m joining the military, baby?”
Her heart stuttered at Jesse’s furious hiss.
“If I hadn’t promised my dad I would follow in his footsteps, I wouldn’t
be going anywhere,” he growled as he took his hand away.
Fear made her strike out. She heard a satisfying crack as her palm hit his
cheek. He cursed and a second later, his mouth landed on hers. The taste of
spearmint mouthwash overwhelmed her as his tongue invaded. She raked
her nails over him and realized he was naked. He hissed, back arching as
she tried to draw blood. His mouth left hers and coasted down to where her
neck flowed into her shoulder. He sank his teeth into her as he grabbed her
wrists and pinned them to the mattress. She kicked her feet as he bit to
punish. When she whimpered, he eased the pressure and then kissed her
throbbing flesh as if he hadn’t used brute force to make her submit like they
were part of the animal kingdom.
“You want to fight, baby? I’m in an obliging mood,” he said against her
skin. “Mom used everything she could to make me quit.” His tongue slid
over her racing pulse. “I assume she asked you to beg me to stay?”
She clenched her teeth.
He nipped her jaw. “Answer me.”
“Yes,” she said sullenly.
He lifted his head to look down at her. With her nightlight at the foot of
her bed, his face was in shadow, but she still felt the intensity of his stare.
“So? What are you going to do, Violet?” He pressed his lips to hers.
“What are you willing to sacrifice to make Mom happy?”
“I love her.”
He stilled.
“But not enough to ask you to stay.”
He was silent for a beat before he said, “So be it.”
He parted her legs with his knee and nestled his erection between her
legs. Her flimsy pajama shorts were poor protection from his scorching heat
and his hard dick, which she knew would be inside of her very soon. She
yanked at her imprisoned wrists, which only made him tighten his grip. She
wished she had the balls to scream her head off and have Mom and Dad
catch him in the act. But she would rather endure whatever Jesse had
planned than witness the look on Dad’s face when he discovered she was no
longer pure.
“You can’t do this here!” she said desperately. “Mom and Dad are right
down the hall!”
“Then we better be quiet.”
As he brushed kisses over her face, she considered head-butting him.
What was with this affectionate bullshit? They rarely kissed. All he usually
cared about was getting off. Foreplay was minimal. That’s how she
preferred it. She just wanted to get this over with. Why…? She stiffened as
it finally hit her.
“How did you get in here? I locked both doors!”
“I broke the lock on the bathroom door.”
“You—”
“Ask Dad to repair it, I’ll break it again.”
He slid off her onto his side and hauled her up in bed, so she was
propped on her pillows. Before she could roll away, he yanked her camisole
down and latched onto her breast while his hand slid into her pants.
“You want me out of your life, fine, but that means I get full access,” he
growled as he parted her.
His middle finger slid in with embarrassing ease.
Ashamed by her body’s response, she snapped, “Can’t you get this from
Faye instead of me?”
“Faye?” he muttered around her nipple.
She gritted her teeth. “Yes, the redhead hanging on your arm at lunch.”
His dick jerked against her thigh. “Jealous?”
She smacked his shoulder as his thumb began to tease her clit. “No! I
want you to find someone else to fulfill your sick fantasies instead of me!”
“There’s little chance of that happening,” he said distractedly as he
worked her. “Faye’s brother just joined the Air Force, so I’ve been talking
to him about his experience and what to expect. I’ve been connecting with
others who are joining other branches, and Faye decided to tag along. She’s
nice, but…”
He rubbed himself against her.
“She isn’t you.” He kissed the base of her throat. “Touch me, Vi.”
Her hand balled into a fist. Quick as lightning, the hand in her pants
disappeared, and his wet finger was shoved into her mouth. She gripped his
wrist with both hands to stop him from shoving his finger down her throat.
“I swear to God if you don’t put your hand on me, I’ll…” He let out a
breath when her hand closed around him. “Good. Now, stroke me the way I
taught you.”
She obeyed, simultaneously sucking on the finger he hadn’t withdrawn
from her mouth. He hissed through his teeth and arched into her touch.
“Slow down,” he ground out.
Fuck you, she thought, tightening her grip to make him blow.
She sensed his control snap a second before he yanked her hand off him.
“I warned you I wasn’t in the mood,” he hissed.
When he sat up and reached for her, she lost her temper. Screw him!
She didn’t care about his mood or what he wanted. He wasn’t supposed to
do this kind of shit when Mom and Dad were present. What the hell was
wrong with him?
They tussled. Her stuffed animals and pillows went flying. Jesse leapt
off the bed, yanked her onto her back and dragged her, so her head was
hanging off the mattress. Before she could figure out why he’d positioned
her so bizarrely, Jesse cupped her jaw, forcing her head back. She had a
split second of warning before his dick slid into her mouth and Jesse
planted himself in her throat.
She panicked, hands and legs wheeling through the air as she choked.
Jesse withdrew enough for her to breathe. She coughed and tried to turn her
head aside, but he collared her throat and ordered, “Be still.”
She moaned in protest and pushed at him, but she was trapped by his
iron thighs and the rock-hard dick impaling her mouth. In this position, she
was completely helpless and at his mercy.
“You didn’t listen to me, so now we’re going to do this my way.” He let
his hand wander from her throat to her breasts. “You’re gonna suck me until
I tell you to stop. You fight me and try to make me come before I’m ready,
you’ll regret it.”
Slowly, he pushed forward. She screwed her eyes shut and made a
concentrated effort not to fight him and control her gag reflex. She heard
him expel his breath and knew he was pleased when he gripped her breast.
“Yes, just like that,” he groaned.
She gripped the backs of his corded thighs and obeyed every husky
command. She was rewarded for her good behavior when he yanked off her
bottoms, spread her thighs, and put his mouth between her legs. As all the
blood rushed to her head, she felt a euphoric rush. Jesse knew her body well
and used everything in his arsenal to rouse her to a fever pitch. She got so
lost in what they were doing that she grabbed his ass to yank him toward
her so she could take every inch of him.
She felt more than heard his guttural groan before he yanked out of her
mouth as if it were an electrical socket. As she lay there, panting, he cupped
the back of her head and lifted it to give her a deep, wet, upside-down kiss.
“That’s my girl,” he husked before he pulled her into a sitting position.
She didn’t have time to get her bearings because he pulled her off the
bed and promptly bent her over it. She buried her face in her tangled sheets,
which was convenient because a second later, she screamed when he
slammed inside of her. He froze with his body blanketing hers, but she was
too far gone to care. She bounced under him and wrapped her hand around
the back of his neck, urging him on. He dropped his head on her shoulder,
panting as he grappled for control.
“You’re killing me, Vi.”
“Hurry,” she whispered.
Outside, the storm seemed to be picking up, thunder crashing like
cymbals, gearing up so they could have this moment.
He nuzzled her cheek. “Tell me you want me.”
She bared her teeth. He wasn’t satisfied that he controlled her body, he
always pushed for more. He was such an asshole.
“Vi, you need this, same as me. You can’t deny it.” When she didn’t
answer, his hand fisted in her hair. “Why can’t you admit it?”
Because she would rather die than give in completely. He may rule her
in these moments, but there was still a part of her he hadn’t conquered.
Would never conquer. It was what gave her the strength to resist and soldier
through every day, even though sometimes she considered giving up. She
would never surrender that piece of her identity to him. If she did, she
would be lost.
He capitulated with a ragged, “Fuck,” before he began to move.
With nature colluding with them to disguise their forbidden tryst, she let
herself go. She let herself enjoy the pleasures of the flesh she normally
denied herself in the light of day and made demands he gave into, leading to
an orgasm that made her gnaw her sheets.
“Tell me,” Jesse pleaded. “Just this one time. Please.”
She ignored him and lay like a limp, wrecked doll. She knew what to
expect and wasn’t disappointed when he went berserk. Jesse took his
frustrations out on her body. When she began to make too much noise, he
clapped a hand over her mouth. When that didn’t work, he shoved her face
in the mattress and put a pillow over her head. He ended up using it himself
when he came, folding over her and shouting her name into the stuffing.
Even as he spilled inside of her, he shoved the pillow away and hissed,
“Deny all you want, but we both know the truth. You love what’s between
us, you’re just too much of a coward to admit it.”
He pulled out of her, spilling down the back of her thighs. By the time
her quivering legs collapsed, and she landed on her knees beside the bed, he
was already gone.
VIOLET.
2 MONTHS LATER.
Despite the warm July evening, there was a healthy fire crackling
in the fire pit. The backyard, house, and garage were filled to capacity for
Jesse’s farewell party. Firefighters mingled with Jesse’s coaches,
teammates, and their church friends. It seemed that half the neighborhood
had decided to attend. Mom’s friends, mostly teachers, went around patting
cheeks and catching up with students they hadn’t seen since elementary
school.
Violet couldn’t believe this day had finally come. Jesse was leaving
tomorrow. A part of her kept expecting something to go wrong—for his
paperwork to fall through or there to be some mix up that would eject him
from the military before he could be shipped off, but everything had gone
smoothly. Mom tried to talk Jesse out of his decision until he swore in, and
there was no turning back. This week had been rough on Mom. She’d
excused herself multiple times from the party to have a crying session.
A commotion in the house caught Violet’s attention. She started forward
as Dad emerged, carrying a massive cake. People clapped Jesse on the back
and ushered him toward the table where Dad set it down. The cake had a
pair of combat boots, a fighter jet, and the Air Force logo with, “We will
miss you, Jesse,” written on it.
At everyone’s urgings, Jesse posed with his cake. Violet felt obliged to
take pictures. Not for herself, but for Lynne. Even with everyone calling out
for Jesse to look in their direction, he looked directly at her. She hastily
took the photo and then fiddled with her phone until Dad began to address
the crowd with his hand on Jesse’s shoulder.
“I’m happy you all could join us to celebrate Jesse before he sets out on
his journey,” Dad said in a voice that carried clearly across the backyard. “I
couldn’t ask for a better son. Lynne and I are so proud of you. We know
you’re going to do great things in the world.”
Everyone whistled and cheered as Dad and Jesse gave each other manly
claps on the back. Lynne walked up to Jesse, dabbing her eyes with her
handkerchief. Clearly too emotional to speak, Lynne kissed Jesse on the
cheek and gave him a hug.
As people turned to Violet with expectant faces, she felt a flash of panic.
No one told her she’d have to say a few words and give Jesse a public
farewell.
“Come, Vi,” Dad said, beckoning to her. “Let’s take a family photo
before we cut the cake.”
She pasted a smile on her face as she made her way over. She and
Lynne stood side by side, while Dad and Jesse stood behind them. As
everyone playfully jostled for the best position to take their photo, pride
swelled in her chest. She knew what the photos would capture. Dad and
Jesse with their impressive, fit figures towering over her and Mom, who
wore matching floral dresses, hers in pink and Mom’s in yellow. Dad and
Jesse wore matching white button up shirts for precisely this reason. Mom
had known there would be a ton of photos taken and wanted them to be
ready. Their family had its issues, but at that moment, Violet didn’t want to
be anywhere else. This is where she belonged.
Blinding flashes came from every direction. Their heads whipped back
and forth, trying to give everyone the opportunity to get the perfect shot, but
it was so chaotic that everyone began to laugh. Grinning, Violet stepped
forward, only to be stopped by a pair of arms that pulled her back against a
toned frame. Jesse wrapped his arms around her, pressed his cheek to hers,
and rocked her from side to side. A series of “aww’s” came from the women
who thought Jesse’s gesture was sweet. She kept her lips curved as her nails
sank warningly into the back of his hand.
“Violet! Jesse! Look here!”
She looked in the direction of the voice and saw her friend Allison
holding up her phone to take their photo. She endured Jesse’s touch for a
few more seconds before she tried to move away. Jesse hesitated for a split
second before he released her.
“This cake is something else,” Violet said enthusiastically as she
stepped up to Mom’s side.
“And it’s supposed to taste even better than it looks,” Mom said as she
handed Jesse the first slice, which was a shocking bright blue.
“It’s blueberry?” Jesse asked, eyeing the cake warily.
Mom laughed. “No, that’s just dye. It’s chocolate.”
Everyone laughed at Jesse’s obvious relief. As Dad went to fetch ice
cream, Violet arranged slices of cake on a tray and began to circulate
through the crowd.
She was waylaid often. It had been a while since she’d seen her uncles
—a mix of firefighters, paramedics, and police officers who had known her
since she was born. They wanted to know if she was going to follow in
Dad’s footsteps, as she’d said she would when she was five. They guffawed
when she gave an adamant, “Nope!”
After a series of hugs, she moved on and found herself face to face with
Pastor Sonny. “Hey!”
“Hey, yourself,” he said and eyed the last plate on her tray. “Is that
spoken for?”
“No! It’s all yours.”
She handed it to him and prepared to run when he tapped her shoulder.
“I’ve been meaning to talk to you, Violet.”
Her heart dropped to her toes as she turned back to him. “You have?”
She avoided him just as much as Jesse, if not more so. If anyone could
discern what was happening, it would be Pastor Sonny. He was a kind man,
but his gaze was piercing and stern, and she felt like he could see straight
through people to their rotten core. She dreaded going to church. It seemed
his sermons were tailor-made to rip her conscience to shreds every week.
“Yes. I was wondering if you were interested in becoming a mentor for
the youth.”
“Mentor?” She cleared her throat. “That’s… wow.”
His eyes tracked over her face and fractionally narrowed. “You’re not
interested.”
It wasn’t a question.
She tucked the empty tray under her arm and glanced around the room
instead of meeting his eyes. “I’ve never considered being a mentor.”
“That’s why I think you should do it. I notice you prefer being in the
background, assisting rather than taking a leadership role, but I think you
have a lot to offer. I’ve known you since you were a little girl. You have
wisdom to share with the young ones who need guidance for this next stage
in life.”
As she struggled to think of something to say, he lightly touched her
arm.
“Think about it and let me know.”
She watched him walk away before she gave herself a shake and hurried
out to the backyard to do exactly what he said she liked to do—assist.
Assisting meant she didn’t have to take the fall if something went awry.
Assisting meant there was always work to be done. Keeping busy kept her
from pondering too much. He thought she had wisdom to share? She was
the last person anyone should come to for advice. She’d made a mess of her
life.
When she tried to load her tray again, Mom gave her a little push.
“You’ve been on your feet all day. If people want cake, they’ll come
looking. Enjoy the party. Go hang out with Jesse and your friends.”
Mom jerked her chin at the fire pit where most of the teenagers had
congregated. She didn’t want to talk to anybody, but she could see Mom
wasn’t going to let her continue to bustle around.
She accepted the cake slice Mom placed in her hands and wandered
over to her peers. Allison hopped up from the lounge chair where she and
her boyfriend, Jesse’s classmate, Blaine, were relaxing.
“This picture of you and Jesse is so cute,” Allison exclaimed as she
tapped her phone screen. “I already posted it and everyone is dying.”
Allison held up her phone, so Violet could see the photo of her and
Jesse. She wasn’t expecting much, considering how far away Allison had
been, but the edited results were devastating. She and Jesse beamed at the
camera, faces pressed together, his arms wrapped around her. There was no
trace of unease, anger, or bitterness on her face. She looked like she didn’t
want to be anywhere else but in his arms. They looked happy. How the hell
was that possible?
“Violet?” Allison lowered the phone and steadied her plate, which was
shaking. “Are you okay?”
She pulled herself together. “Yes, of course.”
Allison rubbed her arm. “I can’t imagine how you feel. You two are
inseparable. It’s going to be so weird seeing you without him.”
“He’s following his dream.”
Allison nodded. “I had no idea he wanted to go into the military. Most
thought he would go into the NFL. I heard some scouts were interested in
him, and that’s why Coach Rick was so upset when he quit football.”
Violet’s stomach flipped. “I never heard that.”
Allison gestured to her boyfriend. “That’s what Blaine said.”
“And what’s Blaine’s plans now that he’s graduated?” Violet asked,
blatantly changing the subject.
Allison lit up. “He’s staying here.”
“That’s great. But didn’t he get into Dartmouth?”
Allison looked over her shoulder at Blaine before she turned back and
whispered, “He decided to stay for me. He was worried we wouldn’t be
able to do long distance, so he’ll wait another year before we decide where
we want to go.”
“Aww, you guys are so in love,” Violet teased.
Allison practically glowed. “Yes, we are. I think he’s it for me.” Allison
gripped her arm and whispered, “He proposed.”
“What?”
“He didn’t get me a ring yet, but we’ve talked about getting married
after I graduate next year.” Allison gave a little squeal. “Can you imagine
me married exactly a year from now?”
“No.”
“Well, if we do, just know you’re going to be a bridesmaid.” Allison
giggled when Violet made a face. “Come on. Who doesn’t love a wedding?
Is it crazy that I want to be the first friend to get married and have kids?”
“Yes,” Violet said emphatically.
Allison pouted. “Can’t you be happy for me? Isn’t he a great guy?”
Violet swallowed hard. “He’s the best.”
“How lucky am I to have found the one in high school? What are the
chances?”
Their mindsets couldn’t be more different. Allison was thinking of
settling down and getting married and having kids, while Violet felt like her
life hadn’t begun. She wanted freedom and to get away from everyone and
everything she’d ever known. Commitment was the last thing on her mind.
Instead of voicing her negative, cynical thoughts, Violet smiled and
offered Allison a piece of her cake.
Two hours later, the crowd had significantly thinned as people began to
take their leave. The mood had shifted as well, becoming more somber as
people said their official goodbyes. Everyone kept giving her sympathetic
pats or squeezes, assuming she was taking Jesse’s departure as bad as Lynne
when she felt nothing at all. Her stoic demeanor had been getting her some
odd, sidelong looks. Shouldn’t people be happy she wasn’t imitating a
human water faucet?
She escaped down the hallway for a break from the intense scrutiny and
entered Jesse’s bedroom. His door had been left ajar, so guests could use
their bathroom if the other was in use. She was relieved to discover it
empty. She turned to close the door, which abruptly began to swing open
again.
“Oh, I’m sorry,” she began with a laugh, intending to say the bathroom
was occupied, but her voice died when Jesse pushed his way in. “What are
you…?”
She didn’t get to finish her question because his head swooped down,
and his mouth settled on hers. He clasped her face and kissed her like the
world was about to end. She was momentarily stunned, but the sound of
someone cheering in the distance reminded her that they had a house full of
guests. What the hell was he doing?
She wrenched her mouth away. “Have you lost your mind?”
“This should be the happiest night of my life,” he said gruffly.
“Everyone I care about is gathered in one place to see me off. I’m about to
set out on my lifelong dream and make my father proud. I should be over
the fucking moon, so why do I feel so miserable?”
Had one of his friends slipped him alcohol, even with cops and a pastor
present? Sucking in an annoyed breath, she looked up, intending to snap
him back to reality, but the sight of his spiky lashes and blue eyes
shimmering with tears made her mind go blank.
“How did I fuck this up so badly?” he said thickly.
She averted her gaze. “Everyone will be looking for you. You should go
back to the party.”
“I can’t leave tomorrow with things like this between us,” he said,
resting his forehead against hers. “Tell me there’s a chance we can still be
together in the future.”
“This isn’t the time for this!” Her voice was terse with stress.
“We’re out of time, Violet. This is it.” He massaged her nape to
encourage her to look at him. “Tell me I didn’t lose the most important
person in the world to me.”
She braced her hand on his chest and strained away from him. “The
door isn’t locked. Anyone could come in. All these people are here for you.
You should be focused on them, not—”
“Look at me!”
His raised voice made her stiffen in alarm.
“Are you crazy? What the hell are you trying to do?” she hissed.
His face flushed with anger as he gripped her shoulders and gave her a
shake. “I’m trying to get through to you. I need you to stop looking through
me and actually hear what I’m saying.”
Of course, he was forcing this confrontation the night before he left,
when everyone they’d ever known was just a few rooms away.
She jutted out her chin. “What are you saying?”
His hands flexed on her shoulders. “I’m saying that I know what I did
was wrong, and you have every right to hate me. I promised to protect you
and couldn’t protect you from myself.”
His expression was a mix of frustration and desperation.
“I know I need to work on myself and that it’s best for both of us if I
leave. I told myself I wouldn’t pressure you, but I need to know.” He
brushed her hair back with trembling fingers. “Give me some hope. Tell me
there’s a part of you that still feels something for me.”
She held his gaze and deliberately let seconds that felt like hours tick
by. She felt no remorse as his face contorted with pain.
He swallowed hard, making his Adam’s apple bob. “Can you forgive
me?”
Months ago, she forgave him without thinking, naively believing what
Dad said—that no act was unforgivable. But what Jesse had done to her,
what he stole over and over again… it wasn’t forgivable. As if he heard her
thoughts, a tear slid down his cheek.
“Vi,” he whispered, but whatever he was going to say was interrupted
by someone calling his name.
Fear gave her the strength to shove him hard enough that he rocked
back.
“They need you. Go!” she ordered.
His anguish was plain to see. Hopefully, everyone would attribute his
distress to nerves over leaving home for the great unknown.
“Violet.”
“Go, now!” she said harshly.
He swiped his sleeve over his dripping eyes before he turned and
walked out of the bathroom. She stood there for a minute, staring at the
place where he’d been standing, before she glanced in the mirror and saw
her pale, blank face. Abruptly, she pushed on the door that led to her
bedroom. The drawers she’d pushed in front of it, so no guests would
wander into her bedroom by accident, gave way. Once she was in, she
repositioned her makeshift barricade and locked her other door as well. She
sent a quick text to Mom, letting her know she had a migraine and needed
to lay down, and got a heart emoji in response.
She kicked off her shoes and, without bothering to change, lay on the
bed in her dress. She stared at the ceiling with her hands folded neatly over
her middle and tried to relax. Jesse’s behavior and mood swings over the
last few weeks had swung from one extreme to the next. Some days he was
cold and remote. On others, he was cruel. The worst days were when he
was affectionate and kind. She didn’t know which Jesse she would get day
to day, so she kept her guard up and didn’t trust any version of him she
encountered.
Including this one.
Can you forgive me?
Her hands balled into fists. How dare he ask her that after everything he
put her through? He’d hijacked not just her junior year, which was one big
blur, he’d taken over her life. He segregated her from everyone, making her
an outcast not just amongst their friends, but in their family as well.
Because no one believed he was capable of such dastardly deeds, she had
no one to confide in or turn to.
To have her brother, who she trusted implicitly, turn into her worst
enemy was a betrayal of such epic proportions that she still couldn’t wrap
her mind around it. She hadn’t just lost her sense of self—she lost her best
friend and confidant. The person she used to run to for comfort, advice, and
support disappeared. In his place was a monster who looked like him and
sounded like him but did the most horrific things to her. He weaponized all
her faults and weaknesses against her.
Jesse stopped seeing her as a person. She became an obsession, an
object to be conquered and claimed. Sex whittled their relationship down to
nothing. Their verbal communication and emotional connection ceased to
exist, leaving them with no foundation to rebuild upon. He irreparably
damaged her trust, not just in him, but herself. How could she trust her
judgment when she’d been so easily duped by his sincere, good brother act?
How could she not have sensed the evil lurking behind his guileless smile?
Her confidence and self-esteem had taken so many blows, she didn’t feel
like a whole person anymore. She no longer knew how to make a simple
decision without examining it from every angle and listing every possible
repercussion and consequence.
Lately, Jesse’s fixation had gone into overdrive. It was like he was
trying to fuse them together. He was insatiable, possessed. To preserve her
sanity against his brutal onslaught, she wrapped herself in a cocoon that
insulated her from his destructive wrath. The more erratic and out of control
Jesse became, the calmer and more detached she was. She could see that
infuriated him, but she didn’t care. Self-preservation was all that mattered.
All she had to do was hang on just a little longer.
She’d been counting down the months, weeks, and now, hours. She
glanced at the clock and felt her heart soar. Twelve hours until he was gone.
Until she got her freedom back. Until everything went back to normal. All
she had to do was close her eyes. When she woke, they would have a few
hours together, and then she could close the book on this chapter of her life
and move on.

VIOLET.
Violet lurched up in bed before her eyes were fully open. Sunlight
filtered through her blinds. She sprang up, energized, even though she’d
only gotten a few hours of sleep. She tossed and turned past midnight,
listening to the constant hum of voices drift down the hallway. She worried
that she may have to deal with Jesse on his final night, but thankfully, he’d
been otherwise occupied.
She muscled aside the drawers to gain access to the bathroom and
hastily locked the door that led to Jesse’s bedroom before she washed her
face and brushed her teeth. There was no sound coming from Jesse’s
bedroom. Either he’d gotten even less sleep than her and was already up, or
he was sleeping soundly. She hoped it was the latter so she wouldn’t have to
deal with him until he was ready to leave.
As she pulled her hair into a ponytail, she met her eyes in the mirror.
Although her body buzzed with excitement, it didn’t reflect in her dull eyes
or stony expression. Keeping their secret had taken its toll.
Once Jesse was gone, she could actually sleep through the night—what
a concept! She could enjoy life again. This was her last full summer in
Texas. She should enjoy it because after she graduated, she was going to get
as far from here as Mom and Dad would allow. Jesse hadn’t even left yet,
and she was already dreading him coming home for a visit. She needed a
place where she felt safe. As long as he was allowed to walk through the
front door, that would never be here. She wanted to forget everything that
had happened between them and bury the sinful desires he provoked within
her.
Tell me I didn’t lose the most important person in the world to me.
If that were true, he would have respected her boundaries. He wouldn’t
have gone as far as he had. He had moments of remorse that never lasted
long. Several times, he had the gall to suggest the things he did were an act
of love. He was so manipulative and controlling. He would say anything to
justify his behavior. His acting skills would serve him well in the future. It
had gotten him this far without being caught.
She unlocked Jesse’s door before she escaped back into her bedroom
and hastily changed out of her pajamas. She walked down the hallway to
the dining room but paused when she heard Mom sniffling and Dad’s
consoling tone.
“I don’t want him to go,” Lynne cried.
“You knew this day would come. Jesse’s smart and strong. He’s going
to do well in the military. It’s what he’s always wanted,” Dad said.
“He’s just liked his father. He’s too willing to lay his life on the line and
too loyal to let anyone down. He’ll give his life to them when there are so
many opportunities outside of the military. He could have done anything! I
was hoping he would change his mind and take after you.”
There was a pause before Dad said, “It’s not like my job doesn’t come
without risks.”
“But at least we get to see you throughout the week. I can’t believe he
didn’t stay for Violet. They were so close. What happened between them?”
Violet retreated to her bedroom. Mom had been convinced she could
make Jesse change his mind and had badgered her more than Jesse. Every
day, she had to lie through her teeth about pleading with Jesse to stay and
being repeatedly turned down. Lynne’s disappointment made her feel awful.
Trying to act as if she were upset about Jesse’s choice when it couldn’t be
further from the truth drained her. She couldn’t wait for him to leave. The
strain of keeping up this act was killing her. Once he left, Mom would learn
how to cope without Jesse being within arm’s reach, and they could build a
new life without him.
She pushed her bedroom door open and stopped on the threshold when
she saw Jesse standing beside her bed.
“Morning,” he said.
“Morning,” she echoed and stayed where she was.
He wore shorts and a white tee with his gold cross on display. His eyes
were bloodshot and puffy from lack of sleep. She hoped, for his sake, his
training didn’t begin the moment he stepped foot on base. Actually, on
second thought, she hoped there was a drill sergeant ready to stomp his ass
the moment he arrived.
“You look…”
He ran his hand through his hair. “I didn’t sleep.”
“What time did everyone leave?”
“Brody left an hour ago.” He rubbed the back of his neck. “I can’t
believe I’m leaving today.”
“I think it’s best.”
He winced but nodded. An awkward silence fell.
“You should rest while you can,” she said.
“No. I can always catch up on sleep. I don’t want to waste the time I
have left.”
His eyes moved over her with such naked hunger that she tensed.
“Vi…”
“Mom’s crying,” she interrupted. “You should go to her.”
“She has Dad.”
“But she wants you.”
“She’s going to have to get used to me not being around.” He extended
his hand, palm up. “Please.”
She hastily drew back. “No.”
“Not that. I just want to hold you, I swear. I…” His expression morphed
into one of abject torment. “I need you, Violet.”
Ignoring his beseeching tone, she turned on her heel and marched down
the hallway. When she entered the dining room, she was grateful to see
Mom’s episode had passed, and she was cooking in the kitchen while Dad
sat at the table, drinking coffee and reading his Bible.
“You’re up early, Vi,” Dad observed.
“Couldn’t sleep,” she said and tried to look sad. She must have done a
good job because Dad held out his arm. Since he wasn’t one to offer hugs,
she seized the opportunity and let him wrap her up tight. A second later, his
hold loosened.
“Jesse,” Dad greeted, ruining their moment.
She didn’t turn to look at him but walked away to help Mom. She took
over cooking, so Mom could sit with Jesse. Pastor Sonny’s words slipped
through her mind as she served breakfast and hopped up every time
someone needed something. For some reason, she couldn’t stay still.
Her hands fidgeted on her lap as Dad shared the passage he’d been
reading in his Bible and wove the scriptures into Jesse’s new beginning.
Mom and Dad said fervent prayers over Jesse to protect and guide him.
When silence fell, an opening for her to add her two cents, she was saved
by a knock at the door. The general contractor Jesse had been working with
hadn’t been able to make it to the party last night, so he stopped by to see
Jesse before he left. Even as Jesse stepped outside to chat with him, several
cars pulled up.
Grateful for the interruption, Violet began to tidy up. She paced around
the backyard, picking up stray napkins and plastic utensils that didn’t make
it into the trash, before she attacked the pile of dishes. Her gaze kept
flicking to the large clock on the wall. Why were these last hours dragging?
When the dish rack was full, she moved onto the half bath their guests had
used and gave it a thorough scrub down.
When she emerged, yanking off her rubber gloves, she saw Dad’s
perplexed expression. She raised her brows in inquiry.
“Are you okay?” he asked.
“Yes. Why?”
“Don’t you think you should be…?” He held up a hand. “Never mind.”
She jutted out her hip. “What?”
“Nothing,” he muttered. “Just thought you’d rather be doing something
other than cleaning toilets right now.”
She supposed he thought she would be clinging to Jesse’s side to soak
up every last second with him. A glance out the front window showed that
even more people had come to say last-minute farewells. Jesse was
surrounded by a small crowd. There was no need for her to fawn over him.
He had enough admirers.
As she plugged in the vacuum, she saw Mom and Dad exchange
concerned looks. They seemed unnerved by her calm, practical demeanor.
She almost wished she could give them the over-the-top emotional reaction
they expected so they would stop looking at her like she was a freak. She
was fine. A little anxious because she hated goodbyes in general. She had no
idea how she was going to handle Jesse’s farewell with their parent’s
present, but she would deal with it when the time came.
She’d vacuumed all the bedrooms and hallway and had made her way to
the living room when Dad strode to the front door with Jesse’s duffel. Her
head whipped toward the clock. Jesse had to leave in less than fifteen
minutes. The blast of excitement was so potent that she went lightheaded
and dropped to her hands and knees. She was so happy, her eyes welled up.
He was really leaving. The vacuum roared beside her, concealing the sound
of her weak giggling, which escalated into joyous laughter. She wasn’t sure
how long she stayed that way, but she snapped out of her delirium when the
vacuum switched off.
“Violet?”
Mom’s hand smoothed over her hair before it rested between her
shoulder blades.
“Did you fall? Are you okay?”
She nodded and opened her mouth to reassure Mom that she was fine,
but there was an invisible obstruction in her throat.
Mom rubbed her back in a circle. “Honey, what’s wrong?”
Lynne’s concerned tone punctured a hole in Violet’s cocoon. The rush of
euphoria was overpowered by a vicious flood of emotion that grabbed her
by the throat, strangling her so she couldn’t breathe.
“Isaac, come! Something’s wrong with Violet. She’s shaking like she’s
having a seizure or something. I—”
A horrible sound ripped through the room. It was the bone-chilling,
tortured scream of a wounded animal. It went on and on. Violet tried to
raise her head to see what was going on, but for some reason, she couldn’t
move. Why wasn’t anyone helping the poor thing? It sounded like it was
being gutted. Someone had to make it stop.
There was a flurry of activity around her, and then she was lifted into
the air. Strong arms wrapped around her and her face was pressed against
an all too familiar chest. In a distant part of her mind, she realized the awful
sound had stopped. She didn’t want Jesse touching her, but she wasn’t in
control of her faculties. She was trembling, covered in cold sweat and…
sobbing? When had that happened?
“Oh, Vi,” Mom choked. “What should we…?”
“Give us a moment,” Jesse rasped.
He moved swiftly. Violet’s ponytail swished from side to side as he
carried her somewhere. He cupped the back of her head as he spoke to her,
but she couldn’t hear a word when she was drowning in a churning sea of
emotions she’d suppressed for far too long. They were back with a
vengeance, ambushing her at the worst possible moment.
Her wailing had turned into pitiful whimpering by the time a door
closed.
“Thank you, God,” Jesse murmured fervently as he lowered her onto
something soft.
Mortification, confusion, and despair sloshed around inside of her as
she tried to wipe her eyes, which was difficult since Jesse was trying to
cover every inch of her face in kisses. She realized they were in her
bedroom, and he’d settled her on the edge of her bed.
“I… I don’t know what’s wrong with me,” she said raggedly.
“Say it,” he pleaded. “I need to hear you admit it just once.”
“Say what?” she said fretfully as she swiped at her dripping nose.
“Tell me you love me.”
“What?”
She jerked back and raised her hand to slap him, but he anticipated that
and seized her wrist.
“Don’t fight. We don’t have time,” he said urgently.
“How dare you say that to me?”
Even in the midst of her fury, she kept her voice down, aware Mom and
Dad were probably hovering at the end of the hallway.
“You’re crying for me,” he pointed out, staring at the tears that
continued to trickle down her cheeks.
“I’m crying because of you, not for you, jackass.”
His fingers flexed around her wrist. “You screamed like someone
plunged a dagger in your heart, Vi.”
A part of her had suspected that she was responsible for that
bloodcurdling, banshee shriek, but she hadn’t wanted to admit it to herself.
She scraped her mind for a plausible explanation for her breakdown. Ten
minutes ago, she could have gone jogging and now, she felt like she had the
flu. She was feverish, shaky, nauseated, and her body ached like she’d been
beaten with a bat.
Jesse cupped her clammy cheek. “You care for me, Violet. As much as
you want to deny it, as much as you wish you didn’t, you do.”
Her free hand twisted in his damp shirt as she bared her teeth at him.
“How could I possibly love someone who’s hurt me as much as you have?”
His mouth twisted in a bittersweet smile. “Because when you love, you
do it with your whole heart. You give so completely, there’s no taking it
back.”
Even as his words speared her heart, she held his gaze as she enunciated
in a voice that trembled, “I do not love you.”
“Okay,” he said gently.
“I hate you,” she spat.
His fingers brushed through her waterfall of tears. “I know.”
She desperately tried to get a hold of herself as her emotions ravaged
her insides. “I need you to go.”
“Is that what you really want?”
“Yes!”
He looked down at the hand she didn’t realize was still twisted in his
shirt. She was horrified to see that, contrary to what her mouth was saying,
she was tugging him toward her. She released him as if he burned her and
shot to her feet. She snatched tissues from her nightstand and frantically
mopped up her face. What the hell was wrong with her? Why couldn’t she
stop crying?
“Violet.”
She whirled with a snarl. “Why are you still here? Go! Leave!”
His eyes were a little wild as he stared at her. “I would have stayed if
you asked me to, but it’s too late.”
Her heart skipped. “I didn’t ask you to.” That fiery volcano inside of her
spewing lava added, “Why would I ask you to stay? I’m thrilled you’re
leaving! This is a dream come true. I’ve been counting down the days!”
“You’re going to deny it to the bitter end,” he said with a shake of his
head.
“There’s nothing to deny! I hate your guts!”
His eyes narrowed a second before he lunged at her. He clapped a hand
over her mouth before she could utter a sound and drove her backward into
the wall.
“You don’t know when to quit,” he bit out through clenched teeth. “If I
had more time, I’d prove what a fucking lie that is.”
He buried his face in her hair, inhaled, and groaned before he slumped
against her.
“How am I going to live without you? I miss you already, and you’re
right here.” His hand fisted in her hair. “I’m going for both our sakes, to
give us time and space to regain some sanity.”
He tugged on her hair, forcing her head back to look at him. His
shadowed gaze, full of aggravated yearning, moved over her face.
“Hopefully, while I’m gone, you’ll come to your senses.”
She yanked his hand off her mouth to hiss, “I have come to my senses! I
never want to see you again!”
A muscle ticked in his jaw. “You’re so fucking stubborn.”
She pushed at his chest. “You have to go.”
“Kiss me goodbye.”
She went rigid. “No!”
“Please. Just this once,” he said raggedly and brushed his lips back and
forth across hers, tempting her to engage. “One last kiss.”
Why did her heart feel like it was breaking? Why was her entire body
trembling with grief and sorrow? This is what she wanted. What she’d
prayed for. She reached the end of the tunnel but hadn’t stepped into the
sunshine. For some reason, she hesitated in the shadows and wasn’t making
a break for freedom. What the hell was wrong with her? Why had one of
her hands twisted in his shirt, once again holding him to her, instead of
shoving him away as he deserved?
As if he knew her tumultuous thoughts, his mouth curved in a shaky,
agonizing smile. His bloodshot eyes were suspiciously bright.
“You’re beautiful on the inside and out, pitying a monster, even though
you try not to. I can see you’re fighting it, but God did say to love your
enemy.”
Even as she hauled in a breath to verbally rip him to shreds, he disarmed
her when he brushed the tip of his nose against hers, a gesture of affection
he hadn’t done since they were kids. Her mind flooded with memories of a
happier time. A time she hadn’t allowed herself to think about because it
hurt too much to remember how much they’d lost. How had this all gone so
wrong? Her mouth trembled as a tear slipped down her face.
“I’m sorry, Violet. For everything. If you can’t forgive me, have mercy
on me.”
She wasn’t sure why that plea made her stomach drop but combined
with the sound of an invisible clock ticking, she felt a mounting sense of
dread and urgency. This was it. He wasn’t going away for a weekend or
even a week or two like he did when he went to sports camps. He was
leaving. They didn’t know when they would see each other again. His life
wouldn’t be his own once he walked out the door. The military would
dictate everything from here on out. She despised him, but if something
happened to him, and she denied him this, could she ever forgive herself?
Shutting down all rational thought, she clasped the back of his neck and
set her mouth on his. Anger was her driving emotion. She funneled the
tornado of her destructive emotions into him. She was the aggressor, the
one who nipped and bit and wanted him to hurt. He let her do what she
wanted to him and when she gave him an opening, he returned her
aggression with tenderness. He kissed her in a way that left her feeling raw,
shaken, and heartbroken.
When her legs gave out, he held her in the crook of one arm and cradled
her face as he cherished her and repented for all the wrong he’d done.
Attuned to him as she was, she sensed his desire, but it was tainted by the
sharp tang of fear. Realizing he wasn’t as confident as he appeared, she
couldn’t stop herself from trying to console him. Her fingers bunched in his
hair as she kissed him back, comforting and reassuring him in the only form
of communicating they had left.
“Jesse?”
Mom’s call seemed to come from a million miles away.
Jesse reluctantly disengaged and cleared his throat before he called out,
“I’ll be out in a minute.”
Eyes awash with regret moved over Violet’s face as if he were trying to
memorize it.
“Thank you,” he said gruffly, and tried to ease away from her, but her
arms locked around him. “Violet?”
She was struck with sudden terror over a future without him in it. He
had been the only constant in her life for almost five years. He was her
tormentor, but also her protector. A part of her knew he would always have
her back, and now she would have no one. She was going to be alone again.
“Vi, I have to go.”
“Jesse.”
She heard the inadvertent plea in her voice. Pain ripped across his
features as he closed his eyes, shedding a tear that he transferred to her
when he gave her a hard kiss.
“I’ll come back,” he said fiercely, before he ripped himself away from
her.
She took a step after him, hand outstretched to grab hold of him, but he
was too quick. He didn’t look back as he strode out of her bedroom. She
listened to his swift, heavy footfalls go down the hall.
“Is Violet okay?” Mom asked.
“No,” Jesse said curtly. “She isn’t going to see me off. We have to get
going.”
There was a flurry of movement and then the sound of the front door
closing, the rev of an engine, and then silence.
Violet dropped to the carpet and finally let loose the scream that had
been bottled up inside of her. Now that she was alone, everything she had
crammed down for over nine months spilled out. She raged, pounding the
carpet with her fists until they were numb. She cried until she retched and,
when she collapsed on the bathroom floor, wondered why she felt like she’d
just lost her best friend.
Violet tossed and turned. She moved around so much, her fitted
sheet came undone, forcing her to remake her bed.
By the time Mom and Dad had returned home, she was semipresentable, though her eyes that were nearly swollen shut let them know
what she’d done in the interim. Strangely, her volatile emotional state
seemed to have cured Lynne of hers. Mom spent the rest of the day treating
her like she was sick—swaddling her with blankets even though it was hot
as hell outside, making her soup, and coddling her.
Violet pummeled her pillow before she flopped on her side and stared at
the bathroom door that she’d closed out of habit. Now, she could leave it
open if she wanted to. She had to remember to ask Dad to fix the lock. She
was so tired, she felt ill, but she couldn’t sleep. She should be dead to the
world, getting the best sleep of her life. Instead, she was staring at the door,
willing it to open.
With a low growl, she rolled out of bed, yanked the door open and
marched into Jesse’s bedroom. She surveyed his tidy, empty room,
illuminated by streetlights, with bitter, glistening eyes.
She ruined the taut sheets when she crawled over it. She breathed deep.
The scent of his musk imbedded in the sheets comforted, even as it
infuriated her.
She rolled onto her back and, under the gaze of his favorite football
player, sank her hand into her pajama bottoms. She was soaking wet.
Depraved memories played through her mind, making her writhe and pant
and when she came, she hated that she moaned his name.
She stared at the ceiling as she came down from her high. She thought
she was reclaiming her sexuality by masturbating in his room, the place
where he initiated and corrupted her. She should have felt victorious, but as
always, she felt empty. She couldn’t believe he was really gone.
She turned onto her belly and, in the darkness, sobbed her heart out.
“Violet?”
She opened her eyes and was confused by the orientation of the room
until she realized she was in Jesse’s. Mom stood in the doorway with bleary
eyes and messy hair.
She opened her mouth to say something, but before she could, the tears
started again. Mom’s expression softened as she came forward. Violet held
up a hand, not wanting to be touched, but Mom ignored that and hauled her
into her arms.
“I know, honey. I miss him too,” Mom murmured.
Violet fisted her hand in Mom’s robe. Her body still yearned for him
and her emotions were still entangled, despite her best efforts to block him
out. It would take time to break the ties between them, but once she did, she
would never let him back in.

VIOLET.
2 MONTHS LATER.
“Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday,
dear Violet,” Mom and Dad sang. “Happy birthday to you!”
Violet couldn’t help but laugh as Lynne clapped, hopped, and sang at
the top of her voice. The kindergarten teacher in her had never been more
evident than at this moment.
“Now close your eyes and make a wish!” Lynne encouraged and held
up a finger. “And know that all your dreams are within reach!”
Violet dutifully closed her eyes for show and waited an appropriate
amount of time before she blew out the candles.
“Woo-hoo!” Lynne cheered and turned on the dining room lights to
reveal the smoking candles. “Eighteen,” Lynne marveled and wrapped her
arms around Violet. “I can’t believe it. You’re all grown up.”
Violet allowed herself to lean into Lynne. Dad watched them with a
fond smile.
Lynne kissed the top of her head. “You’re the best daughter. We’re so
happy to have you here with us.”
Violet lowered her gaze and ignored the sudden lump in her throat.
Lynne gave her a squeeze and went into the kitchen to fetch bowls and ice
cream.
“Did you have a good day at school?” Dad asked.
Violet nodded and, to avoid eye contact, reached out to stroke the velvet
petals of a rose in a vase in the middle of the table. “Everyone remembers
my birthday since it’s back-to-back with us starting school. My friends got
me enough balloons to make my backpack float,” she joked.
“Are you sure you don’t want a party? This is the first time you haven’t
had one, and eighteen’s such a special year,” Lynne said as she cut into the
strawberry cake.
“I don’t need a party. I’m happy with this,” Violet said, gesturing
between the three of them. “And you paid for us to go to that concert. We’ll
celebrate then.”
“Here you go.” Mom placed a generous slice of strawberry cake and
two scoops of ice cream in front of her. “For the sweetest birthday girl.”
They had followed the same ritual for her birthday that Lynne
established five years ago. She woke to one dozen pink roses and red velvet
pancakes for breakfast, followed by her favorite meal for dinner and now
strawberry cake and ice cream. Usually, she had a party on the weekend
after her birthday, but this year she asked to skip it. The concert tickets
Mom and Dad had bought for her and her friends were more than enough.
Everything was as it should be. Better, actually. So, why wasn’t she happy?
Why didn’t she feel anything?
She refused to look to her left, where Jesse used to sit. Even though he
wasn’t there, she felt the heaviness of his presence. He was everywhere and
yet, nowhere. It had been almost two months since he left. She assumed
once he was gone that she would magically revert to who she’d been, only
to realize that part of her was gone forever.
Her grand plans of enjoying the rest of her summer never came to
fruition. After Jesse left, she shut down. She had a hard time getting out of
bed and struggled to do basic daily functions. The thing that snapped her
out of her zombie state was Mom suggesting she speak to Pastor Sonny or
one of the other church leaders. Fear of being questioned galvanized her
into action.
She thought she would no longer have to act, but she was putting on the
performance of her life. All eyes had always been on Jesse. Without him to
deflect everyone’s attention from her, she now had to work three times as
hard to appear normal. She did what was required of her. She did her
chores, went to church, and had recently returned to school for her senior
year. She responded when spoken to and smiled on command, but she felt
absolutely nothing. When she was alone and no longer had to pretend that
she was like everyone else, she plummeted into a mental space so bleak that
she worried about her sanity.
Although she’d been half expecting it, her heart stopped when Mom’s
phone rang. Mom dropped her bowl with a clatter and sprinted to the
counter, where the phone was charging. From her delighted expression,
Violet knew who the caller was before Mom announced, “It’s Jesse!”
As her body went numb, she asked Dad, “How’s Uncle Perry?”
Dad took his gaze from Mom and focused on her. “He’s still in the
hospital.” Dad shook his head. “He dropped two stories with that toddler in
his arms. The kid didn’t have a scratch. Perry’s lucky he just broke his leg
and not his—”
“Violet?”
She turned her head and saw Mom holding out her cell phone.
“Jesse wants to wish you a happy birthday.”
Even as dread weighted down her limbs, making her stumble as she rose
from her chair, Violet tried to look eager rather than sick to her stomach.
Mom gave her a puzzled look as she handed over the phone. “Jesse said
he’s been trying to get in touch with you all day.”
Violet pressed the mute button before she said, “Really? Huh. I don’t
know why I didn’t see his messages.” She put the phone to her ear and said
a bright, “Hello?”
“Violet?”
The sound of Jesse’s voice unleashed a torrent of emotion that made her
knees buckle. She braced her hand on the table as she bowed her head and
closed her eyes to get a handle on herself.
“Thank you,” she said, as if Jesse had wished her a happy birthday and
tried to inject some warmth and enthusiasm into her voice as she asked,
“How are you doing?”
She hadn’t heard his voice since the day he left. She blocked his number
so he wouldn’t be able to contact her, and managed to avoid speaking to
him whenever he called their parents by making herself scarce or saying she
would call him back on her phone and never doing so. She considered
having a party just to have more people around so she would have an
excuse to skirt this phone call. Stupidly, she’d hoped Jesse would forget or
be too busy to call. Now she had no choice but to carry on a fake
conversation in front of her parents. She would leave it up to Jesse to
explain why he was unable to hear anything on his end. He was good at
making up lies.
“I’m sorry, I didn’t get your messages. Maybe I need to get my phone
checked out,” she said.
“Mom, are you there?” Jesse asked impatiently.
Her nails sank into her palms. Memories swarmed over her, reviving
needs she was desperately trying to forget. She opened her eyes and saw
Mom watching her intently. Violet flashed a megawatt smile as she said,
“We just finished dinner. We’re eating cake and ice cream.” She let out a
false laugh and said, “No. Not German chocolate cake, but we did have
buttermilk pie recently. Dad got two pies all to himself.”
“That’s what you get when you go to the military! No home cooked
meals!” Dad said loudly and took a swat on the arm from Mom before he
carried his bowl into the living room to finish eating in front of the TV.
“Mom? Violet?” Jesse called.
Violet moved into the kitchen as Mom began to clear the table and
asked, “What have you been up to? Are they treating you good?”
“Mom,” Jesse bit out.
Violet’s stomach churned. He sounded different. Harder, colder. Even
his voice had deepened.
“Mom? What the hell?” Jesse snapped and hung up.
Violet blew out a breath. “Uh-huh,” she said, nodding. “That doesn’t
sound too bad.” She wiped down the counters as she chattered for show.
“School’s been good. At first, I loved driving myself everywhere, but now I
miss being a passenger princess. Can you believe that? Oh my gosh. You
know who I saw recently? I…”
She yanked the phone away from her ear when it began to ring loudly.
Why hadn’t she thought to turn off the volume? Damn! When Mom
frowned, Violet widened her eyes. “I didn’t even know we got
disconnected.”
She answered the phone and immediately pressed the mute button
again.
“How long was I talking to myself?” Violet asked ruefully.
“Mom?” Jesse called in a clipped tone.
“That long?” Violet chuckled before she flicked her hand. “I was just
talking about school and wishing you could chauffeur me around like the
good old days.”
When Mom turned away with a smile and went to join Dad in the living
room, Violet’s tense shoulders dropped.
Jesse’s voice abruptly hardened. “Damn it, Vi. I know you’re there.
Answer me.”
Her hand tightened on the phone. “You’re almost done with basic
training, right?”
“It’s been two months,” he rasped. “Let me hear your voice.”
Fuck him. She wouldn’t give him anything he wanted ever again, even
if it was just the sound of her voice.
“Oh, really?” she asked, trying to sound interested.
“If you don’t talk to me, I’m going to tell Mom,” Jesse said.
Outrage seared her throat. She should be the one threatening him, not
the other way around! She wanted to slam the phone on the counter until it
came apart in pieces. Instead, she held her smile, though it was now more of
a sneer as she unmuted the call. Thankfully, Mom and Dad were watching
the news and not paying attention to her.
“You’re an asshole,” she said quietly.
He exhaled before he said grimly, “This is the only way I can get you to
talk to me since you blocked me.”
“You’re blocked for a reason.”
He ignored that and asked, “How… how have you been?”
He sounded nervous and awkward.
She glanced at Mom and Dad before she hurried down the hallway to
her bedroom. If she had to speak to him, she wanted privacy to say what she
needed to.
“I was okay until I had to talk to you,” she retorted as she closed her
bedroom door and punched one of the balloons a friend had given her.
“I wanted to tell you happy birthday.”
“Thank you,” she said ungraciously. “Is that it?”
“No, I…”
“You what?” she demanded. “What do you want from me?”
She hated the warble in her voice. She’d hoped the next time they
interacted that she would be stone-cold, but clearly, not enough time had
passed. His voice whipped her emotions into a frenzy. She hated that he had
such power over her, but she hated even more her body’s response. The
neglected space between her legs throbbed, begging to be possessed. What
the hell was wrong with her? What kind of sicko missed the fucked-up
things he used to do to her?
A filthy slut, that’s who, her inner critic jeered. She bit her lip hard
enough to make it bleed to disrupt the scathing litany and focused in time to
hear Jesse say, “I want what I’ve always wanted. You.”
Her hand whistled as it slashed through the air. “You can’t have me!
You’ll never have me. I want nothing to do with you. Why can’t you
understand that?”
“I didn’t call to upset you,” he said wearily
“Then you should have left me alone! You know I don’t want to talk to
you. Why force me?”
His voice shredded as he said with a little heat of his own, “Because I
miss you! Not seeing you, not being able to talk to you has been hell. We’ve
never been apart this long. I’m going crazy. Don’t you miss me at all?”
She swallowed the lump in her throat. The worst part was, she did miss
him, and she hated herself for it.
Her prolonged silence made him sigh. She couldn’t see him, but she
imagined him running his hands through his hair.
“I thought…” He hesitated and then said in a rush, “The day I left, you
held on to me. You didn’t want me to go. Damn it, you kissed me back, Vi!”
She flinched as her stomach churned, threatening to expel her favorite
cake. That day haunted her because it demonstrated how weak she was
when it came to him. It didn’t matter what he did to her. Her defenses
would never be as strong as they needed to be where he was concerned. She
had to keep him at a distance, which was possible now that he was in the
military. She thought she’d built up some resistance to him, but this phone
call proved her shields were as sturdy as wet napkins.
“You can’t hold what I did that day against me. I didn’t know what I
was doing! I was messed up—I’m still messed up because of you. I don’t
know if I’ll ever be…”
She pressed the back of her hand to her mouth to smother a rogue sob
without success. She shut her eyes, utterly humiliated. She hadn’t even been
talking to him for two minutes, and she was spiraling out of control.
“Don’t cry,” he said gruffly. “Or so help me God, I’m going to show
up.”
“I’m not crying,” she lied defiantly. “And you can’t ‘show up’. They
decide what you do now.”
“That’s why I wanted to talk to you. I’m almost done with basic
training, and I have the opportunity to come home before I—”
“What?” she quietly shrieked.
“I may be able to stay for a week or two before I ship off to Alaska.”
“D-did you mention this to M-mom or Dad?” She was so rattled, her
words tripped over one another.
“No. I wanted to talk to you first. It was supposed to be a surprise for
your birthday.”
“No!”
“I need to see you,” he said desperately. “I’m dying without you.”
“You can’t shove me back into your twisted game again! I can’t do it!”
“I won’t,” he began earnestly, but she cut him off.
“Don’t make promises we both know you can’t keep!”
The thought of seeing him again threw her into a panic. She thought she
would have six months or more to prepare before facing him. The thought
of seeing him any sooner was horrifying.
“You don’t know what you did to me,” she said in a strangled voice. “I
am not okay. I’m just starting to feel human again, and you want to come
back and break me all over again.”
“I don’t—”
“You’ve done it countless times! That’s all you know how to do! I don’t
know how you can live with yourself when I don’t want to live with myself.
How do you do it?”
“Violet.”
His voice cracked like a whip, but she didn’t want to hear what he had
to say. He had to stay away. Her sanity depended on it. She was barely
hanging on. If he came back, it would destroy her. She couldn’t take another
round of him, not when she had finally adjusted to his absence. In the past,
she did her best to keep him from seeing how much damage he inflicted,
but she would reveal all if it would keep him at bay.
“I thought once you were gone, I would feel better, but…” She
shuddered as the ever-present shame rose up to choke her. “Every time I get
in the car, I think of all the things you’ve done to me in it. I go to church,
and I think of what you did to me on that stage. I go to school, and I think
of all the places you took me, the things you forced me to do…” Her hands
brushed at the invisible sludge she could feel on her body, but could never
remove, no matter how hard she scrubbed.
“Baby.”
She stomped her foot. “Don’t call me that! Don’t call me anything.
Don’t talk to me!” she said wildly as she mentally unraveled.
“Violet.”
“Do you know what I did today?” She clutched the phone in a death
grip as her eyes filled with tears. “My friends wanted to treat me to lunch,
but instead of going with them, I drove to that park where you broke me the
first time. The place where you showed me the real you. I sat there and
thought about ending it all.”
There was no sound on the other end of the line. She wasn’t sure if the
call dropped, but she kept talking. Now that she’d confessed the dark path
her mind had taken to the one person who would understand why, she
couldn’t stop.
“I am barely hanging on,” she said hoarsely as tears poured down her
face. “All the secrets and lies… I can’t do it anymore. I can’t live like this.”
As the pain mounted to an unbearable degree, her eyes flicked around
the room for something to inflict damage on her person before she closed
her eyes, willing away the violent, compulsive urges brought on by the selfloathing she couldn’t shirk.
“If you ever felt anything for me, you’d stay away.”
Silence.
“I’ll never ask anything of you ever again,” she pleaded. “Just don’t
come home, at least while I’m here. After I graduate, you can see Mom and
Dad whenever you want.”
“Is that what you really want?” he asked in a stifled tone.
“Yes.”
There was a brief pause and then, “If that’s what you need.”
Relief made her legs weak. She collapsed on the edge of her bed and
dropped her face in her hand. “Thank you.”
“Violet, I… I never meant to hurt you.”
She knew he heard her whimpering because his voice broke.
“I swear I can fix this if you give me a chance.”
“You can’t f-fix something that’s shattered into a m-million pieces,” she
said raggedly.
“I’ll spend the rest of my life finding every piece and putting it back
where it belongs,” he said fervently.
“I used to think you were heaven sent,” she said in a hollow voice. “I
loved you more than I loved myself. I made so many excuses for you
because I didn’t want to believe the truth.” Her breath hitched before she
finished, “You’re the worst thing that ever happened to me. I don’t ever
want to see you again.”
The call ended. She wasn’t sure if they got disconnected or if he hung
up. Either way, she was grateful because she reached the end of her rope.
The phone tumbled across the carpet after it fell from her nerveless fingers.
She had officially severed their bond. She felt the disconnect as acutely
as if she severed a limb. Internally, she was screaming that same
bloodcurdling cry she had the day he left. It was the grief-stricken wail of a
woman who had lost someone she didn’t think she could live without, but
she had no choice. Cutting him out of her life was the only way she could
cope. She had the misfortune to give her heart to a monster who damaged
her so severely, she would never be the same. It was the right thing to do, so
why did she feel like she was back in that dark tunnel without light or hope?
She wrapped her arms around herself and folded at the waist. Fat, salty
tears rained down on her pink heart socks. Her agony was so profound she
couldn’t make a sound.
She lost countless battles, but she just won the war. Jesse would honor
his promise. She would never see him again. She should have been elated
and relieved. Instead, she mourned. Jesse was right. When she loved, she
did it completely, which meant she would never be whole again.
